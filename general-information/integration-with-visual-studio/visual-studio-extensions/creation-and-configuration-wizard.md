# Create Project




Telerik ASP.NET AJAX Visual Studio Extensions will help you to quickly create an application pre-configured to use Telerik® UI for ASP.NET AJAX. The fastest way to have such a project is using the Visual Studio New Project Wizard. Having opened it, the following four Telerik Ajax project templates could be found under the Telerik -> Web node:

For convenience the same project templates could be found under the Visual C# -> Web and Visual Basic -> Web nodes.

After you click the OK button, you get the Create New Project Wizard, provided by the Telerik® UI for ASP.NET AJAX Visual Studio Extensions. The wizard detects all the installed versions of Telerik UI for ASP.NET AJAX and lists them in the Version combobox. You can select a version which you want to be applied to your project. The following options could be set into the Create new project wizard:

![introduction-vsx newproject 1](images/introduction-vsx_newproject1.png)

* **Language** - Select the Telerik project language (the option is only available in the **New Project Wizard**). You can choose between two options: C# or VB. 

* **Project Type** - Select the Telerik project type (the option is only available in the **New Project Wizard**). You can choose between two options: APP (Application) or SITE (Web Site).

* **Project Template** - Select the Telerik project template (the option is only available in the **New Project Wizard**). The Blank template only references the assemblies and has the [mandatory additions to the web.config]({%slug general-information/web-config-settings-overview%}#mandatory-additions-to-the-webconfig). The *Responsive* template uses the [RadPageLayout]({%slug pagelayout/overview%}) control to provide a basic template for a responsive web page. The *Outlook-inspired* template joins the power of some of the most popular controls in Telerik® UI for ASP.NET AJAX to create one of the most recognizable applications in the world – Microsoft Outlook. You can easily spot **RadGrid**, **RadButton**, **RadInput**, **RadScheduler** and **RadCalendar** how blend seamlessly. The Visual Studio template can be used as a layout for a quick start of any other business application and it is available after R2 2016.

>note If you prefer the Telerik assemblies to be copied into your solution folder, the **Copy referenced assemblies to solution and source control** option could be selected *only* into the [Visual Studio Extensions Options]({%slug introduction/radcontrols-for-asp.net-ajax-fundamentals/integration-with-visual-studio/visual-studio-extensions/visual-studio-extensions-options%}) but it is not applicable for Visual Studio web site projects.

>note When creating a new project, the [Render Mode]({%slug controls/render-modes%}) of the Telerik controls is automatically set to **Lightweight**.
