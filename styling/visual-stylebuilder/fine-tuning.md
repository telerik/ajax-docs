# Fine Tuning

The **Visual Style Builder** tool, previously available at [http://stylebuilder.telerik.com](http://stylebuilder.telerik.com), was designed to produce skins for the **Classic RenderMode** only. It entered maintenance in May 2016 and has been **discontinued as of 2025 Q2**. The **Classic** render mode itself has been in [maintenance mode since Q3 2015](https://docs.telerik.com/devtools/aspnet-ajax/controls/render-modes).

We recommend using the **Lightweight** render mode and the provided [Telerik ThemeBuilder for ASP.NET AJAX](https://demos.telerik.com/aspnet-ajax/themebuilder/) tool. You can learn how to use the tool in the [ThemeBuilder Overview](https://www.telerik.com/products/aspnet-ajax/documentation/styling/theme-builder/overview) article.
