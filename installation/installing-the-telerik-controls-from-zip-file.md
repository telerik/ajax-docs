>caution  **Prerequisite** 
>In order to have the Telerik® UI for ASP.NET AJAX running, you will need to have [ASP.NET AJAX](http://www.asp.net/AJAX/Documentation/Live/InstallingASPNETAJAX.aspx) installed on your development/production machine.


The **ZIP** is used to install Telerik® UI for ASP.NET AJAX manually for upgrading or updating purposes.The folder structure is different from the **MSI** installation. You need to be familiar with with ASP.NET, IIS, setting permissions and creating virtual folders. Commonly, the **ZIP** is installed directly in **inetpub/wwwroot**.

## Install without IIS Running

To install the Telerik® UI for ASP.NET AJAX suite on your machine from the **ZIP** file, follow the instructions below:

1. Log into your [Telerik account](http://www.telerik.com/account/default.aspx) and click on **Downloads** from the top menu.

1. On the loaded page choose from your purchased products or trial downloads Telerik® UI for ASP.NET AJAX, and click on it.

1. Download the **Manual installation** (**ZIP**) file.The **ZIP** file contains the following folders:
	
	* **AdditionalLibraries** - contains the [Telerik document processing libraries]({%slug introduction/installation/included-assemblies%}#telerik-document-processing-libraries) allowing you to import and export content between different formats.	
	
	* **BinXX** - contains the Telerik  controls assemblies (.dll files), where **XX** represents the version of the .NET framework against which the assemblies are built.

	* **EditorDialogs** - contains the **Editor** dialog files.

	* **ImageEditorDialogs** - contains the **ImageEditor** dialog files.

	* **Live Demos** - contains the product Quick-Start Framework and examples and the VisualStudio solution file opening them. You can start the samples directly from this folder, using the **StartExamples.exe** file.

	* **Scripts** - all controls part of the suite have their scripts embedded as web resources. However if you need to modify a script or use it as an external, you can find it in this folder.
	
	* **Skins** - all controls part of the suite have their skins embedded as web resources. However if you need to modify a skin or use it as an external one, you can find it in this folder.

	* **TypeScriptDefinitions** - contains the TypeScript definitions for the Telerik® UI for ASP.NET AJAX client-side objects.


1. Give full permissions to the **ASP.NET** user (if you are using IIS5) or to the **Network** **Service** account (under IIS6, Windows Server 2003) on the folder where the files were extracted.

>caution
>If you are using a modified or external script, you need to set the **EnableEmbeddedScripts** property to **false** . If you don't do that the control will fail to load its client scripts with an exception.
