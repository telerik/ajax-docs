>important As of Q1 2011, Telerik UI for ASP.NET AJAX is shipped with .NET 3.5 and above assemblies only.	The following page contains more information about the product support lifecycle of the controls:
>[http://www.telerik.com/aspnet-ajax/tech-sheets/net-support](http://www.telerik.com/aspnet-ajax/tech-sheets/net-support)
>


>caution  **Prerequisite** 
>In order to have Telerik UI for ASP.NET AJAX running, you will need to have[ASP.NET AJAX](http://ajax.asp.net/)installed on your development/production machine.
>See also[General ASP.NET AJAX Information](85BC8323-A04F-4A84-9E29-E1B2A122FC19).
>


The **MSI** files are intended for easy and automatic installation of a product. The **MSI** installs the suite on your computer to a folder named **Telerik** in your Program Files, automatically creating the necessary virtual folders and projects. Additionally, it installs the help file(s) in the VS.NET IDE and in your local copy of [MSDN](http://msdn.microsoft.com/), if you have one installed.

>note The latest package available for download already has all updates/HOTFIXES applied. There is no need to update it further.
>


>note The MSI installation will not overwrite previous Telerik UI for ASP.NET AJAX installations, unless it is of the same version.

1. Once the download completes, run the **MSI** file and follow the instructions.On a 32bit machine the wizard will install the Telerik UI for ASP.NET AJAX component in the following folder unless you specify otherwise: **C:\Program Files\Telerik\** and the path is **C:\Program Files (x86)\Telerik\** for a 64bit machine.

To view running examples of the Telerik UI for ASP.NET AJAX functionality, you can launch the Live Demos in either of the following ways:

* Using the Start Menu programs: open **Telerik -> UI for ASP.NET AJAX QX YYYY Live Demos -> UI for ASP.NET AJAX QX YYYY Live Examples**

* Using Windows Explorer: Navigate to the Telerik control Installation Folder (typically *C:\Program Files\Telerik\RadControls for ASPNET AJAX QX YYYY\*) and double-click the **StartExamples.exe** file

* Load the Live Examples solution to your Visual Studio and start the project (F5). The fastest way to load the solution is using the Start Menu: **Telerik -> UI for ASP.NET AJAX QX YYYY -> Open Sample Web Site in Visual Studio**. VisualStudio will start the Live Demos locally using the integrated ASP.NET Development Server.
