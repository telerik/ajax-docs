# Trial License Limitations



## Developer Licenses

Developer licenses come with modified DLLs, which work without displaying copyright messages. If you have a Developer license for one or more of the Telerik components, you only need to ensure that you are using the developer build when downloading the control(s). These builds have the **Dev** abbreviation in their file names.

If your application is displaying a copyright message intermittently, this means that you are using a trial version of the product. Log in to your [Telerik account](http://www.telerik.com/account/default.aspx) and download the developer build through the **Products & Subscriptions** menu and its Purchased Products section. To update your project, please take a look at the [Upgrading the Trial License to a Production License]({%slug introduction/installation/upgrading-instructions/upgrading-a-trial-to-a-developer-license-or-to-a-newer-version%}) section for step-by-step instructions.



## Trial Licenses

The free trial licenses of all Telerik products are **fully functional** and will work for an unlimited time but with copyright message (see below) displayed randomly on the page.

## Trial copyright messages

The trial licenses will occasionally display the following message on your webform:

>Thank you for using the Trial Version of Telerik® UI for ASP.NET AJAX to build more powerful applications faster. [Purchase the Commercial Version now](http://www.telerik.com/purchase/individual/aspnet-ajax.aspx?utm_source=trial&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=Ajax) to get access to all product updates and the Telerik expert support.
