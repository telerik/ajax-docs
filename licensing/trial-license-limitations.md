# Trial License Limitations



## Developer Licenses

Developer licenses come with modified DLLs, which work without displaying copyright messages. If you have a Developer license for one or more of the Telerik components, you only need to ensure that you are using the developer build when downloading the control(s). These builds have the **Dev** abbreviation in their file names.

If your application is displaying a copyright message intermittently, this means that you are using a trial version of the product. Log in to your [Telerik account](http://www.telerik.com/account/default.aspx) and download the developer build through the **Products & Subscriptions** menu and its Purchased Products section. To update your project, please take a look at the [Upgrading the Trial License to a Production License]({%slug introduction/installation/upgrading-instructions/upgrading-a-trial-to-a-developer-license-or-to-a-newer-version%}) section for step-by-step instructions.



## Trial Licenses

The free trial licenses of all Telerik products are **fully functional** and will work for an unlimited time but with copyright message (see below) displayed randomly on the page.

## Trial copyright messages

The trial licenses will occasionally display the following message on your webform:

Telerik UI for ASP.NET AJAXtrial version. Copyright Telerik © 2002-2012. To remove this message, please, [purchase a developer version](http://www.telerik.com/purchase.aspx).
