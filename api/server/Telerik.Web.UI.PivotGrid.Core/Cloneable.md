## Methods

###  Clone

Creates a new instance of the , making deep copies of the object's values.

#### Returns

`Telerik.Web.UI.PivotGrid.Core.Cloneable` A clone of the current object.

###  CreateInstanceCore

When implemented in a derived class, creates a new instance of the  derived class.

#### Remarks
Do not call this method directly (except when calling base in an implementation). This method is called internally by the  method whenever a new instance of the  is created.
            Notes to Inheritors.
            Every  derived class must implement this method. A typical implementation is to simply call the default constructor and return the result.

#### Returns

`Telerik.Web.UI.PivotGrid.Core.Cloneable` New instance for cloning.

###  CloneCore

Makes the instance a clone (deep copy) of the specified .

#### Remarks
Notes to Inheritors
            If you derive from , you may need to override this method to copy all properties.
            It is essential that all implementations call the base implementation of this method (if you don't call base you should manually copy all needed properties including base properties).

#### Parameters

#### source `Telerik.Web.UI.PivotGrid.Core.Cloneable`

The object to clone.

#### Returns

`System.Void` 

###  CloneOrDefault

If source is null - returns default().
            If source is not null makes a copy of type .
            If the copy is from a different type throws appropriate exception.

#### Parameters

#### source ```0`

The source that is about to be copied.

#### Returns

`Telerik.Web.UI.PivotGrid.Core.T` Clone of  of type . If source is null - default().
