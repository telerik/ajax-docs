This property describes the different types of font embedding: Link,

#### Remarks
Possible values:
                Link
                            The font program is referenced by name in the rendered PDF. Anyone who
                            views a rendered PDF with a linked font program must have that font
                            installed on their computer otherwise it will not display correctly.
                        Embed
                            The entire font program is embedded in the rendered PDF. Embedding the
                            entire font program guarantees the PDF will display as intended by the
                            author on all computers, however this method does possess several
                            disadvantages:
                        
                                    Font programs can be extremely large and will significantly
                                    increase the size of the rendered PDF. For example, the MS
                                    Gothic TrueType collection is 8MB!
                                
                                    Certain font programs cannot be embedded due to license
                                    restrictions. If you attempt to embed a font program that
                                    disallows embedding, RadScheduler will substitute the font with a
                                    base 14 font and generate a warning message.
                                Subset (default value)Subsetting a font will
                            generate a new font that is embedded in the rendered PDF that contains
                            only the chars referenced by RadScheduler. For example, if a particular
                            RadScheduler utilised the Verdana font referencing only the character 'A', a
                            subsetted font would be generated at run-time containing only the
                            information necessary to render the character 'A'.
                            Subsetting provides the benefits of embedding and significantly reduces
                            the size of the font program. However, small processing overhead is
                            incurred to generated the subsetted font.
