# Telerik.Pdf.FileIdentifier

A File Identifier is described in section 8.3 of the PDF specification.
                The first string is a permanent identifier based on the contents of the file
                at the time it was originally created, and does not change as the file is
                incrementally updated.  The second string is a changing identifier based
                on the file's contents the last time it was updated.

#### Remarks
If this class were being use to update a PDF's file identifier, we'd need
                to add a method to parse an existing file identifier.
