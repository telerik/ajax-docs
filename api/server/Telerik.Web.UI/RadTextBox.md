# Telerik.Web.UI.RadTextBox

RadTextBox is a simple input control for letting the user enter text values.
            It shares the common properties of all RadInput controls, including support
            for skins, styles for different states, empty message support, conditional
            postback on text change, flexible caret and button positioning, labels, and so on.
            You can find information on the Server-side API of RadTextBox at https://docs.telerik.com/devtools/aspnet-ajax/controls/textbox/server-side-programming/properties .

## Properties

###  AccessKey `String`

Gets or sets the access key that allows you to quickly navigate to the
            Web server control.

###  AutoCompleteType `AutoCompleteType`

Gets or sets a value that indicates the AutoComplete behavior of the input control

#### Remarks
To assist with data entry, Microsoft Internet Explorer 5 and later and
                Netscape support a feature called AutoComplete. AutoComplete monitors a RadInput control
                and creates a list of values entered by the user. When the user returns to the
                input at a later time, the list is displayed. Instead of retyping a previously
                entered value, the user can simply select the value from this list. Use the
                AutoCompleteType property to control the behavior of the AutoComplete feature for a
                RadInput control. The System.Web.UI.WebControls.AutoCompleteType enumeration is
                used to represent the values that you can apply to the AutoCompleteType property.
                Not all browsers support the AutoComplete feature. Check with your browser to
                determine compatibility.By default, the AutoCompleteType property for a RadInput control is set to
                AutoCompleteType.None. With this setting, the RadInput control shares the list
                with other RadInput controls with the same ID property across different pages.
                You can also share a list between RadInput controls based on a category, instead
                of an ID property. When you set the AutoCompleteType property to one of the
                category values (such as AutoCompleteType.FirstName, AutoCompleteType.LastName, and
                so on), all RadInput controls with the same category share the same list. You can
                disable the AutoComplete feature for a RadInput control by setting the
                AutoCompleteType property to AutoCompleteType.Disabled.Refer to your browser documentation for details on configuring and enabling
                the AutoComplete feature. For example, to enable the AutoComplete feature in
                Internet Explorer version 5 or later, select Internet Options from the Tools menu,
                and then select the Content tab. Click the AutoComplete button to view and modify
                the various browser options for the AutoComplete feature.This property cannot be set by themes or style sheet themes.

###  AutoPostBack `Boolean`

Gets or sets a value indicating whether an automatic post back to the server
            occurs whenever the user presses the ENTER or the TAB key while in the RadInput
            control.

#### Remarks
Use the AutoPostBack property to specify whether an automatic post back to the
            server will occur whenever the user presses the ENTER or the TAB key while in the
            RadInput control.

###  CausesValidation `Boolean`

Gets or sets a value indicating whether validation is performed when the
            RadInput control is set to validate when a postback occurs.

#### Remarks
Use the CausesValidation property to determine whether validation is
                performed on both the client and the server when a RadInput control is set to
                validate when a postback occurs. Page validation determines whether the input
                controls associated with a validation control on the page all pass the validation
                rules specified by the validation control.By default, a RadInput control does not cause page validation when the
                control loses focus. To set the RadInput control to validate when a postback
                occurs, set the CausesValidation property to true and the AutoPostBack property to
                true.When the value of the CausesValidation property is set to true, you can also
                use the ValidationGroup property to specify the name of the validation group for

###  DisabledStyle `InputStyle`

Gets the style properties for disabled RadInput control.

#### Remarks
Use this property to provide a custom style for the disabled RadInput
                control. Common style attributes that can be adjusted include foreground color,
                background color, font, and alignment within the RadInput. Providing a different
                style enhances the appearance of the RadInput control.Disabled style properties in the RadInput control are inherited from one
                style property to another through a hierarchy. For example, if you specify a red
                font for the EnabledStyle property, all other style properties in the RadInput
                control will also have a red font. This allows you to provide a common appearance
                for the control by setting a single style property. You can override the inherited
                style settings for an item style property that is higher in the hierarchy by
                setting its style properties. For example, you can specify a blue font for the
                DisabledStyle property, overriding the red font specified in the EnabledStyle
                property.To specify a custom style, place the <DisabledStyle> tags between the
                opening and closing tags of the RadInput control. You can then list the style

                Providing a different style enhances the appearance of the RadInput
                control.Empty message style properties in the RadInput control are inherited from
                one style property to another through a hierarchy. For example, if you specify a
                red font for the EnabledStyle property, all other style properties in the
                RadInput control will also have a red font. This allows you to provide a common
                appearance for the control by setting a single style property. You can override the
                inherited style settings for an item style property that is higher in the hierarchy
                by setting its style properties. For example, you can specify a blue font for the
                FocusedStyle property, overriding the red font specified in the EnabledStyle
                property.To specify a custom style, place the <EmptyMessageStyle> tags between

                control will also have a red font. This allows you to provide a common appearance
                for the control by setting a single style property. You can override the inherited
                style settings for an item style property that is higher in the hierarchy by

            cannot change this property; only the developer can. The Text value of a RadInput
            control with the ReadOnly property set to true is sent to the server when a postback
            occurs, but the server does no processing for a read-only RadInput. This prevents a
            malicious user from changing a Text value that is read-only. The value of the Text
            property is preserved in the view state between postbacks unless modified by
            server-side code. This property cannot be set by themes or style sheet themes.

                specific category. Each validation group can be validated independently from other
                validation groups on the page. Use the ValidationGroup property to specify the name
                of the validation group for which the RadInput control causes validation when it
                posts back to the server.This property has an effect only when the CausesValidation property is set to
                true. When you specify a value for the ValidationGroup property, only the
                validation controls that are part of the specified group are validated when the
                RadInput control posts back to the server. If you do not specify a value for
                this property and the CausesValidation property is set to true, all validation
                controls on the page that are not assigned to a validation group are validated when
                the control posts back to the server.This property cannot be set by themes or style sheet themes.

            RadTextBox.

            RadTextBox control automatically continues on the next line when the text reaches the
            end of the control. This property is applicable only when the RadTextMode property is
            set to MultiLine

## Methods

###  ApplyConditionalRendering

Use this from RenderContents of the inheritor

#### Returns

`System.Void` 

###  ControlPreRender

Code moved into this method from OnPreRender to make sure it executed when the framework skips OnPreRender() for some reason

#### Returns

`System.Void` 

###  Focus

Sets input focus to a RadInput.

#### Remarks
Use the Focus method to set the initial focus of the Web page to the
                RadInput. The page will be opened in the browser with the control
                selected.The Focus method causes a call to the page focus script to be emitted on the
                rendered page. If the page does not contain a control with an HTML ID attribute
                that matches the control that the Focus method was invoked on, then page focus will
                not be set. An example where this can occur is when you set the focus on a user
                control instead of setting the focus on a child control of the user control. In
                this scenario, you can use the FindControl method to find the child control of the
                user control and invoke its Focus method.
