# Telerik.Web.UI.RadTimePicker

A Telerik.Web.UI.RadDateInput control in time only mode with an integrated
            Telerik.Web.UI.RadTimeView control to let users enter a time directly in the
            input area or select it from the popup time view control. The values of the
            two controls are synchronized to allow further change of the chosen time.
