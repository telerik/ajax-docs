## Properties

###  AutoPostBack `Boolean`

Gets or sets a value indicating whether a postback to the server automatically occurs when the user interacts with the control.

#### Remarks
Setting this property to true will make Telerik RadCalendar postback to the server
            on date selection or when navigating to a different month.

###  Calendar `Calendar`

Gets the default System.Globalization.Calendar instance as
            specified by the default culture.

#### Remarks
A calendar divides time into measures, such as weeks, months, and years. The
                number, length, and start of the divisions vary in each calendar.Any moment in time can be represented as a set of numeric values using a
                particular calendar. For example, the last vernal equinox occurred at (0.0, 0, 46,
                8, 20, 3, 1999) in the Gregorian calendar. An implementation of Calendar can
                map any DateTime value to a similar set of numeric values, and
                DateTime can map such sets of numeric values to a textual representation
                using information from Calendar and DateTimeFormatInfo. The
                textual representation can be culture-sensitive (for example, "8:46 AM March 20th
                1999 AD" for the en-US culture) or culture-insensitive (for example,
                "1999-03-20T08:46:00" in ISO 8601 format).A Calendar implementation can define one or more eras. The
                Calendar class identifies the eras as enumerated integers where the current
                era (CurrentEra) has the value 0.In order to make up for the difference between the calendar year and the
                actual time that the earth rotates around the sun or the actual time that the moon
                rotates around the earth, a leap year has a different number of days than a
                standard calendar year. Each Calendar implementation defines leap years
                differently.For consistency, the first unit in each interval (for example, the first
                month) is assigned the value 1.The System.Globalization namespace includes the following
                Calendar implementations: GregorianCalendar,
                HebrewCalendar, HijriCalendar,
                JapaneseCalendar, JulianCalendar,
                KoreanCalendar, TaiwanCalendar, and
                ThaiBuddhistCalendar.

###  CalendarCaption `Calendar`

Gets or sets a value for RadCalendar caption.

#### Remarks
Setting this property to empty string will force Telerik RadCalendar to not render caption tag

###  CalendarDayTemplates `CalendarDayTemplateCollection`

Gets or sets a collection of type
            
            CalendarDayTemplateCollection which stores the created templates to use with
            RadCalendar. All of the
            items are represented by
            DayTemplate
            instances.

###  CalendarSummary `Calendar`

Gets or sets a value for RadCalendar summary.

#### Remarks
Setting this property to empty string will force Telerik RadCalendar to not render summary attribute

###  CalendarTableStyle `Calendar`

Gets the style properties for the Calendar table container.

###  CalendarView `Calendar`

Exposes the top instance of CalendarView or its derived
                types.Every CalendarView class handles the real calculation and
                rendering of RadCalendar's calendric information. The
                CalendarView has the
                
                ChildViews collection which contains all the sub views in case of multi view
                setup.

###  CellAlign `HorizontalAlign`

Gets or sets the horizontal alignment of the date cells content inside the
                calendar area.The HorizontalAlign enumeration is defined in
                System.Web.UI.WebControls

#### Remarks
Member nameDescriptionCenterThe contents of a container are centered.JustifyThe contents of a container are uniformly spread out and
                        aligned with both the left and right margins.LeftThe contents of a container are left justified.NotSetThe horizontal alignment is not set.RightThe contents of a container are right justified.

###  CellDayFormat `String`

Gets or sets the format string that will be applied to the dates presented in the
            calendar area.

#### Remarks
For additional details see Date Format Pattern
            topic

###  CellVAlign `VerticalAlign`

Gets or sets the vertical alignment of the date cells content inside the
                calendar area.The VerticalAlign enumeration is defined in
                System.Web.UI.WebControls

#### Remarks
Member nameDescriptionBottomText or object is aligned with the bottom of the enclosing
                        control.MiddleText or object is aligned with the center of the enclosing
                        control.NotSetVertical alignment is not set.TopText or object is aligned with the top of the enclosing
                        control.

###  ClientEvents `CalendarClientEvents`

Gets the instance of
            
            CalendarClientEvents class which defines the JavaScript functions (client-side
            event handlers) that are invoked when specific client-side events are raised.

###  ClientIDMode `ClientIDMode`

This property is overridden in order to support controls which implement INamingContainer.
            The default value is changed to "AutoID".

###  ColumnHeaderImage `String`

Gets or sets the image displayed for the column header element.

#### Remarks
This property applies only if the ShowColumnHeaders property
                is set to true. If ColumnHeaderText is set too,
                its value is set as an alternative text to the image of the column header.When using this property, the whole image URL is generated using also the
                ImagesBaseDir
                value.Example:ShowColumnHeaders="true"ImagesBaseDir = "Img/"ColumnHeaderImage = "selector.gif"complete image URL : "Img/selector.gif"

###  ColumnHeaderText `String`

Gets or sets the text displayed for the column header element.

#### Remarks
Use the ColumnHeaderText property to provide custom text
                for the CalendarView complete column header element.This property does not automatically encode to HTML. You need
                                to convert special characters to the appropriate HTML value, unless
                                you want the characters to be treated as HTML. For example, to
                                explicitly display the greater than symbol (>), you must use the
                                value &gt;.Because this property does not automatically encode to HTML, it is possible
                to specify an HTML tag for the ColumnHeaderText property. For
                example, if you want to display an image for the next month navigation control, you
                can set this property to an expression that contains an
                <img> element.This property applies only if the ShowColumnHeaders
                property is set to true.

###  CssClass `String`

Gets or sets the Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) class rendered by the Web server
            control on the client.

###  CssClassFormatString `String`

The CssClass property will now be used instead of the former Skin
            and will be modified in AddAttributesToRender()

###  CssFile `String`

Gets or sets the name of the file containing the CSS definition used by RadCalendar. Use "~/" (tilde) as a substitution of the web-application root directory.

###  CultureInfo `CultureInfo`

Gets or sets the CultureInfo instance that represents
                information about the culture of this RadCalendar object.A CultureInfo class describes information about the culture of this
                RadCalendar instance including the names of the culture, the writing system, and
                the calendar used, as well as access to culture-specific objects that provide
                methods for common operations, such as formatting dates and sorting strings.

#### Remarks
The culture names follow the RFC 1766 standard in the format
                "<languagecode2>-<country/regioncode2>", where <languagecode2> is
                a lowercase two-letter code derived from ISO 639-1 and <country/regioncode2>
                is an uppercase two-letter code derived from ISO 3166. For example, U.S. English is
                "en-US". In cases where a two-letter language code is not available, the
                three-letter code derived from ISO 639-2 is used; for example, the three-letter
                code "div" is used for cultures that use the Dhivehi language. Some culture names
                have suffixes that specify the script; for example, "-Cyrl" specifies the Cyrillic
                script, "-Latn" specifies the Latin script.The following predefined CultureInfo names and identifiers are
                accepted and used by this class and other classes in the System.Globalization
                namespace.Culture NameCulture IdentifierLanguage-Country/Region"" (empty string)0x007Finvariant cultureaf0x0036Afrikaansaf-ZA0x0436Afrikaans - South Africasq0x001CAlbaniansq-AL0x041CAlbanian -

###  DateRangeSeparator `String`

Gets or sets the separator string that will be put between start and end months in a multi view title.

###  DateTimeFormat `DateTimeFormatInfo`

Gets or sets a DateTimeFormatInfo instance that defines the
            culturally appropriate format of displaying dates and times as specified by the default
            culture.

#### Remarks
A DateTimeFormatInfo can be created only for the invariant
                culture or for specific cultures, not for neutral cultures.The cultures are generally grouped into three sets: the invariant culture,
                the neutral cultures, and the specific cultures.The invariant culture is culture-insensitive. You can specify the invariant
                culture by name using an empty string ("") or by its culture identifier 0x007F.
                InvariantCulture retrieves an instance of the invariant culture.
                It is associated with the English language but not with any country/region. It can
                be used in almost any method in the Globalization namespace that requires a
                culture. If a security decision depends on a string comparison or a case-change
                operation, use the InvariantCulture to ensure that the behavior will be
                consistent regardless of the culture settings of the system. However, the invariant
                culture must be used only by processes that require culture-independent results,
                such as system services; otherwise, it produces results that might be
                linguistically incorrect or culturally inappropriate.A neutral culture is a culture that is associated with a language but not
                with a country/region. A specific culture is a culture that is associated with a
                language and a country/region. For example, "fr" is a neutral culture and "fr-FR"
                is a specific culture. Note that "zh-CHS" (Simplified Chinese) and "zh-CHT"
                (Traditional Chinese) are neutral cultures.The user might choose to override some of the values associated with the
                current culture of Windows through Regional and Language Options (or Regional
                Options or Regional Settings) in Control Panel. For example, the user might choose
                to display the date in a different format or to use a currency other than the
                default for the culture.If UseUserOverride is true and the specified culture
                matches the current culture of Windows, the CultureInfo uses those
                overrides, including user settings for the properties of the
                DateTimeFormatInfo instance returned by the DateTimeFormat property,
                the properties of the NumberFormatInfo instance returned by the
                NumberFormat property, and the properties of the
                CompareInfo instance returned by the CompareInfo
                property. If the user settings are incompatible with the culture associated with
                the CultureInfo (for example, if the selected calendar is not one of the
                OptionalCalendars ), the results of the methods and the values of
                the properties are undefined.Note: In this version of RadCalendar the
                NumberFormatInfo instance returned by the
                NumberFormat property is not taken into account.

###  DayCellToolTipFormat `String`

Gets or sets the format string that is applied to the days cells tooltip.

#### Remarks
The property should contain either a format specifier character or a
                custom format pattern. For more information, see the summary page for
                System.Globalization.DateTimeFormatInfo.By default this property uses formatting string of
                'dddd, MMMM dd, yyyy'. Valid formats are all supported by the .NET
                Framework.Example:"d" is the standard short date pattern."%d" returns the day of the month; "%d" is a custom pattern."d " returns the day of the month followed by a white-space character; "d "
                    is a custom pattern.

###  DayNameFormat `DayNameFormat`

Specifies the display formats for the days of the week used as selectors by
            RadCalendar.

#### Remarks
Use the DayNameFormat property to specify the name format for the days
                of the week. This property is set with one of the DayNameFormat
                enumeration values. You can specify whether the days of the week are displayed as
                the full name, short (abbreviated) name, first letter of the day, or first two
                letters of the day.The DayNameFormat enumeration represents the display formats for the
                days of the week used as selectors by RadCalendar.Member nameDescriptionFirstLetterThe days of the week displayed with just the first letter. For
                        example, T.FirstTwoLettersThe days of the week displayed with just the first two
                        letters. For example, Tu.FullThe days of the week displayed in full format. For example,
                        Tuesday.ShortThe days of the week displayed in abbreviated format. For
                        example, Tues.

                                value &gt;.Because this property does not automatically encode to HTML, it is possible
                to specify an HTML tag for the RowHeaderText property. For
                example, if you want to display an image for the next month navigation control, you
                can set this property to an expression that contains an
                <img> element.This property applies only if the ShowRowsHeaders
                property is set to true.

#### Remarks
Use the SelectedDate property to determine the selected date on the

                control.The SelectedDate property and the
                SelectedDates
                collection are closely related. When the
                EnableMultiSelect
                property is set to false, a mode that allows only a single date selection,
                SelectedDate and SelectedDates[0] have the same value and
                SelectedDates.Count equals 1. When the EnableMultiSelect property is
                set to true, mode that allows multiple date selections, SelectedDate
                and SelectedDates[0] have the same value.The SelectedDate property is set using a System.DateTime
                object.When the user selects a date on the RadCalendar control, the
                SelectionChanged
                event is raised. The SelectedDate property is updated to the selected date.
                The SelectedDates collection is also updated to contain just this
                date.Note Both the SelectedDate property and the
                    SelectedDates collection are updated before the SelectionChanged
                    event is raised. You can override the date selection by using the
                    OnSelectionChanged event handler to manually set the
                    SelectedDate property. The SelectionChanged event does not get
                    raised when this property is programmatically set.

###  SelectedDates `DateTime`

Gets a collection of
            RadDate objects (that
            encapsulate values of type System.DateTime) that represent the
            selected dates on the RadCalendar control.

#### Remarks
Use the SelectedDates collection to determine the currently selected
                dates on the
                RadCalendar
                control.The
                SelectedDate
                property and the SelectedDates collection are closely related. When the
                EnableMultiSelect
                property is set to false, a mode that allows only a single date selection,
                SelectedDate and SelectedDates[0] have the same value and
                SelectedDates.Count equals 1. When the
                EnableMultiSelect
                property is set to true, mode that allows multiple date selections,
                SelectedDate and SelectedDates[0] have the same value.The SelectedDates property stores a collection of
                RadDate objects (that
                encapsulate values of type System.DateTime).When the user selects a date or date range (for example with the column or
                rows selectors) on the RadCalendar control, the
                SelectionChanged
                event is raised. The selected dates are added to the SelectedDates
                collection, accumulating with previously selected dates. The range of dates are not
                sorted by default. The SelectedDate property is also updated to
                contain the first date in the SelectedDates collection.You can also use the SelectedDates collection to programmatically
                select dates on the Calendar control. Use the
                
                Add,
                
                Remove,
                
                Clear, and
                
                SelectRange methods to programmatically manipulate the selected dates in the
                SelectedDates collection.Note Both the SelectedDate property and the
                    SelectedDates collection are updated before the SelectionChanged
                    event is raised.You can override the dates selection by using the
                    OnSelectionChanged event handler to manually set the
                    SelectedDates collection. The SelectionChanged event is not
                    raised when this collection is programmatically set.
