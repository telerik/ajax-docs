The RadPanelBarcontrol is used to display a list of items in a Web Forms
                    page and is often used control for building  collapsible side-menu
                    interfaces. The RadPanelBarcontrol supports the following features:
                bullet Databinding that allows the control to be populated from various
                    datasourcesProgrammatic access to the RadPanelBarobject model
                    which allows to dynamic creation of panelbars, populate items, set
                    properties.Customizable appearance through built-in or user-defined skins.ItemsThe RadPanelBarcontrol is made up of tree of items represented
                    by Telerik.Web.UI.RadPanelItem RadPanelItemobjects. Items at the first level (level 0) are
                    called root items. A items that has a parent item is called a child item. All root
                    items are stored in the P:Telerik.Web.UI.RadPanelBar.Items Itemscollection. Child items are
                    stored in a parent item's P:Telerik.Web.UI.RadPanelItem.Items Itemscollection.
                Each item has a P:Telerik.Web.UI.RadPanelItem.Text Textand a P:Telerik.Web.UI.RadPanelItem.Value Valueproperty.
                       The value of the P:Telerik.Web.UI.RadPanelItem.Text Textproperty is displayed in the RadPanelBarcontrol,
                       while the P:Telerik.Web.UI.RadPanelItem.Value Valueproperty is used to store any additional data about the item,
                       such as data passed to the postback event associated with the item. When clicked, a item can
                    navigate to another Web page indicated by the P:Telerik.Web.UI.RadPanelItem.NavigateUrl NavigateUrlproperty.
