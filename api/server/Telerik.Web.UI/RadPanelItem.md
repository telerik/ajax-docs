# Telerik.Web.UI.RadPanelItem

This partial Class defines RadPanelItem object that inherits NavigationItem, IRadPanelItemContainer
            and ICloneable.

#### Remarks
The Telerik.Web.UI.RadPanelBar RadPanelBarcontrol is made up of items. Items which are immediate children
                       of the panelbar are root items. Items which are children of root items are child items.
                   A item usually stores data in two properties, the P:Telerik.Web.UI.RadPanelItem.Text Textproperty and
                       the P:Telerik.Web.UI.RadPanelItem.Value Valueproperty. The value of the P:Telerik.Web.UI.RadPanelItem.Text Textproperty is displayed
                       in the RadPanelBarcontrol, and the P:Telerik.Web.UI.RadPanelItem.Value Valueproperty is used to store additional data.
                   To create panel items, use one of the following methods:bullet Use declarative syntax to define items inline in your page or user control.
                       Use one of the constructors to dynamically create new instances of the
                           Telerik.Web.UI.RadPanelItem RadPanelItemclass. These items can then be added to the
                           Itemscollection of another item or panelbar.
                       Data bind the RadPanelBarcontrol to a data source.
                       When the user clicks a panel item, the RadPanelBarcontrol can navigate
                    to a linked Web page, post back to the server or select that item. If the
                    P:Telerik.Web.UI.RadPanelItem.NavigateUrl NavigateUrlproperty of a item is set, the
                    RadPanelBarcontrol navigates to the linked page. By default, a linked page
                    is displayed in the same window or frame. To display the linked content in a different
                       window or frame, use the P:Telerik.Web.UI.RadPanelItem.Target Targetproperty.
