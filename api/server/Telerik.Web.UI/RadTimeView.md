# Telerik.Web.UI.RadTimeView

The RadTimeView control works only as a popup embedded in a Telerik.Web.UI.RadTimePicker or Telerik.Web.UI.RadDateTimePicker control.
            The main reason to add a RadTimeView control from the toolbox to the Web page is when using it as a shared popup control.

## Inheritance Hierarchy

## Properties

###  AccessKey `String`

Gets or sets the access key.

###  AlternatingTimeStyle `TableItemStyle`

Gets the style properties for alternating time sells in the
             RadTimeView control.

#### Remarks
Use the AlternatingTimeStyle property to provide a custom
                 style for the alternating time cells in the RadTimeView control.
                 Common style attributes that can be adjusted include foreground color, background
                 color, font, and content alignment within the cell. Providing a different style
                 enhances the appearance of the RadTimeView control.If you specify a red font for the TimeStyle property, all
                 other item style properties in the RadTimeView control will also
                 have a red font. This allows you to provide a common appearance for the control by
                 setting a single item style property. You can override the inherited style settings
                 for an item style property that is higher in the hierarchy by setting its style
                 properties. For example, you can specify a blue font for the
                 AlternatingTimeStyle property, overriding the red font specified
                 in the TimeStyle property.To specify a custom style for the alternating items, place the
                 <AlternatingTimeStyle> tags between the opening and closing tags of the
                 RadTimeView control. You can then list the style attributes within
                 the opening <AlternatingTimeStyle> tag.

###  AlternatingTimeTemplate `ITemplate`

Gets or sets the template for alternating time cells in the RadTimeView.

#### Remarks
Use the AlternatingTimeTemplate property to control the
                 contents of alternating items in the RadTimeView control. The
                 appearance of alternating time cells is controlled by the
                 AlternatingTimeStyle property.To specify a template for the alternating time cells, place the
                 <AlternatingTimeTemplate> tags between the opening and closing tags of the
                 RadTimeView control. You can then list the contents of the
                 template between the opening and closing <AlternatingTimeTemplate>
                 tags.

###  BackColor `Color`

                System.Drawing.Color object.In general, only controls that render as a <table> tag can display a
                background color in HTML 3.2, whereas almost any control can in HTML 4.0.For controls that render as a <span> tag (including Label, all
                validation controls, and list controls with their RepeatLayout property set to
                RepeatLayout.Flow), this property will work in Microsoft Internet Explorer version

                to all four sides of a cell.All cells in the same column of a data listing control share the same cell
                width. Therefore, if the content of one cell is longer than the content of other
                cells in the same column, the padding amount is applied to the widest cell. All
                other cells in the column are also set with this cell width.Similarly, all cells in the same row share the same height. The padding
                amount is applied to the height of the tallest cell in the row. All other cells in
                the same row are set with this cell height. Individual cell sizes cannot be

                and horizontally. The cell spacing is uniform for the entire data list control.
                Individual cell spacing between each row or column cannot be specified.The value of this property is stored in view state.

                for all controls. It will always be rendered as the class attribute, regardless of
                the browser.For example, suppose you have the following RadTimeVeiw

                            the hours since midnight. A single-digit hour is formatted without a

###  TimeOverStyle `TableItemStyle`

Gets the style applied to items

###  TimeStyle `TableItemStyle`

Gets the style properties for the time cells in the RadTimeView
             control.

#### Remarks
Use this property to provide a custom style for the items of the
                 RadTimeView control. Common style attributes that can be adjusted
                 include foreground color, background color, font, and content alignment within the
                 cell. Providing a different style enhances the appearance of the
                 RadTimeView control.If you specify a red font for the TimeStyle property, all
                 other item style properties in the RadTimeView control will also
                 have a red font. This allows you to provide a common appearance for the control by
                 setting a single item style property. You can override the inherited style settings
                 for an item style property that is higher in the hierarchy by setting its style
                 properties. For example, you can specify a blue font for the
                 AlternatingTimeStyle property, overriding the red font specified
                 in the TimeStyle property.To specify a custom style for the items of the RadTimeView
                 control, place the <TimeStyle> tags between the opening and closing tags of
                 the RadTimeView control. You can then list the style attributes
                 within the opening <TimeStyle> tag.You can also use the AlternatingTimeStyle property to provide a different
                 appearance for the alternating items in the RadTimeView
                 control.

###  TimeTemplate `ITemplate`

Gets or sets the template for the heading section of the RadTimeView
             control.

#### Remarks
Use the HeaderTemplate property to control the contents of
                 the heading section. The appearance of the header section is controlled by the
                 HeaderStyle property.To specify a template for the heading section, place the
                 <HeadingTemplate> tags between the opening and closing tags of the
                 RadTimeView control. You can then list the contents of the
                 template between the opening and closing <HeadingTemplate> tags.The ShowHeader property must be set to true for this property to be
                 visible.
