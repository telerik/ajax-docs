# Telerik.Web.UI.RadDockLayout

Workflow:
            1). OnInit - ensure that the framework will call TrackViewState, LoadViewState and SaveViewState.
                   We expect that all child docks will be created here.
            2). TrackViewState - raise LoadDockLayout event in order to let the developer to supply
                   the initial parents of the registered docks, because the docks could be created with
                   different parents than needed.
            2a). LoadViewState - loads and applies the dock parents from the ViewState in order to persist
                   the dock positions between the page postbacks.
            3). LoadPostData - returns true to ensure that RaisePostDataChangedEvent()
            3a). Dock_DockZoneChanged - this event is raised by each dock in its LoadPostData method.
                   We handle this event and store the pair UniqueName/NewDockZoneID in the _clientPositions
                   Dictionary. This Dictionary will be used in #4.
            4). RaisePostDataChangedEvent - sets the parents of the registered docks according their
                   positions, set on the client. These positions are stored in the _clientPositions Dictionary.
            5). OnLoad, other events, such as Click, Command, etc. If you create a dock here it will be
                   rendered on the page, but if it is not recreated in the next OnInit, it will not persist
                   its position, set on the client!
            6). SaveViewState - stores the dock parents in the ViewState in order to persist their positions
                   between the page postbacks.
            7). Page_SaveStateComplete - raises the SaveDockLayout event to let the developer to save
                   the state in a database or other storage medium.
            Note: The dock parents will be stored in the ViewState if StoreLayoutInViewState is set
            to true (default). Otherwise the developer should take care of the dock positions when the page
            is posted back.

## Properties

###  EnableAjaxSkinRendering `String`

Gets or sets the value, indicating whether to render the skin CSS files during Ajax requests.

#### Remarks
If EnableAjaxSkinRendering is set to false you will have to register the needed control base CSS file by hand when adding/showing the control with Ajax.

###  EnableEmbeddedBaseStylesheet `Boolean`

Gets or sets the value, indicating whether to render the link to the embedded base stylesheet of the control or not.

#### Remarks
If EnableEmbeddedBaseStylesheet is set to false you will have to register the needed control base CSS file by hand.

###  EnableEmbeddedSkins `String`

Gets or sets the value, indicating whether to render links to the embedded skins or not.

#### Remarks
If EnableEmbeddedSkins is set to false you will have to register the needed CSS files by hand.
            
            If the Skin property is set, RadDockLayout will set the Skin and EnableEmbeddedSkins properties
            of each child RadDock and RadDockZone, unless their Skin property is not explicitly set.

###  EnableLayoutPersistence `Boolean`

Specifies wheter the built-in state storing should be enabled.

###  IsSkinSet `String`

For internal use.

###  LayoutPersistenceRepositoryType `DockLayoutPersistenceRepository`

Gets or sets the type of the data repository to be used for storing the state.

#### Remarks
The corresponding StorageProvider will be used for the state storing functionality.

###  LayoutRepositoryID `String`

Gets or sets the key identifier of the stored RadDocks' states.

#### Remarks
The corresponding StorageProvider will be used for the state storing functionality.

###  RegisteredDocks `ReadOnlyCollection`1`

Returns all registered docks with this RadDockLayout control.

###  RegisteredZones `ReadOnlyCollection`1`

Returns all registered zones with this RadDockLayout control.

###  RenderingMode `RenderMode`

Specifies the rendering mode of the control. Setting the mode to Lightweight will yield
            HTML 5/CSS 3 html and css.

#### Remarks
Lightweight rendering mode might change the outlook of the component in some older browsers
            that don't support CSS3/HTML5.

###  Skin `String`

Gets or sets the skin name for the child controls' user interface.

#### Remarks
If this property is set, RadDockLayout will set the Skin and EnableEmbeddedSkins properties
            of each child RadDock and RadDockZone, unless their Skin property is not explicitly set.

###  StorageProvider `IStateStorageProvider`

Gets or sets the StateStorageProvider instance that will be used for the built-in state storing.

###  StoredIndices `Dictionary`2`

This is the container where we will store the dock indices set on the client.

###  StoredPositions `Dictionary`2`

This is the container where we will store the dock positions set on the client.

###  StoreLayoutInViewState `Boolean`

By default RadDockLayout will store the positions of its inner docks in
            the ViewState. If you want to store the positions in other storage medium
            such as a database, or the Session, set this property to false. Setting this
            property to false will also minimize the ViewState usage.

## Methods

###  GetEmbeddedSkinNames

Returns the names of all embedded skins. Used by Telerik.Web.Examples.

#### Returns

`System.Collections.Generic.List`1` 

###  GetRegisteredDocksState

Cycles through all registered docks and retrieves their state, depending
            on the omitClosedDocks parameter and the value of the Closed property of
            each RadDock control. The List returned by this method could be used to
            recreate the docks when the user visits the page again.

#### Parameters

#### omitClosedDocks `System.Boolean`

A bool value that specifies whether the closed RadDock controls should be excluded from the state.

#### Returns

`System.Collections.Generic.List`1` A List, containing UniqueName/DockState pairs.

###  GetRegisteredDocksState

Cycles through all registered docks and retrieves their state. The List
            returned by this method could be used to recreate the docks when the user
            visits the page again.

#### Returns

`System.Collections.Generic.List`1` A List, containing UniqueName/DockState pairs.

###  OnLoadDockLayout

Raises the LoadDockLayout event.

#### Parameters

#### e `Telerik.Web.UI.DockLayoutEventArgs`
