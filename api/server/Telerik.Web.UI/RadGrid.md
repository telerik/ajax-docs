# Telerik.Web.UI.RadGrid

RadGrid control class.

#### Remarks
Set properties of RadGrid as default for the corresponding properties of grid's
            table views Telerik.Web.UI.GridTableView .
            The best approach to bind RadGrid is to handle its E:Telerik.Web.UI.RadGrid.NeedDataSource event and set the DataSource property
            there. This way RadGrid will handle automatically operations like paging, sorting, grouping, etc.
            The main table-view can be accessed through P:Telerik.Web.UI.RadGrid.MasterTableView property.
            The group panel and its items can be accessed using GroupPanel property. Note that the group items can be modified only
            through the P:Telerik.Web.UI.GridTableView.GroupByExpressions properties of each GridTableView.
            Hierarchical grid structure can be implemented adding GridTableView objects to P:Telerik.Web.UI.GridTableView.DetailTables and handling
            E:Telerik.Web.UI.RadGrid.DetailTableDataBind event, where you should set the DataSource of each bound detail table filtered
            according to the P:Telerik.Web.UI.GridTableView.ParentItem property key values.
            The P:Telerik.Web.UI.RadGrid.Columns of RadGrid property is a reference to the columns of the MasterTableView and is present in RadGrid for
            compatibility with the DataGrid server control.
            You can find more information on the server properties and events of RadGrid at the Server-Side Programming Overview article here: https://docs.telerik.com/devtools/aspnet-ajax/controls/grid/server-side-programming/overview .

## Properties

###  AccessKey `String`

Gets or sets the access key that allows you to quickly navigate to the
            Web server control.

###  ActiveItemStyle `GridTableItemStyle`

Gets a reference to the GridTableItemStyle object that allows you to set the
            appearance of the active item in a Telerik RadGrid control.

#### Remarks
Use the ActiveItemStyle property to control the appearance of the active item
                in a Telerik RadGrid control. This property is read-only; however, you
                can set the properties of the GridTableItemStyle object it returns. The properties
                can be set declaratively using one of the following methods:Place an attribute in the opening tag of the Telerik RadGrid
                    control in the form Property-Subproperty, where Subproperty is a property of
                    the GridTableItemStyle object (for example, ActiveItemStyle-ForeColor).Nest a <ActiveItemStyle> element between the opening and closing
                    tags of the Telerik RadGrid control.The properties can also be set programmatically in the form
                Property.Subproperty (for example, ActiveItemStyle.ForeColor). Common settings
                usually include a custom background color, foreground color, and font
                properties.

###  AllowAutomaticDeletes `Boolean`

Gets or sets a value indicating whether Telerik RadGrid will
            automatically delete records from the specified data source.

#### Remarks
See Automatic Data Source
            Operations for details.

###  AllowAutomaticInserts `Boolean`

Gets or sets a value indicating whether Telerik RadGrid will perform
            automatic insert of records to the data source.

#### Remarks
See Automatic Data Source
            Operations for details.

###  AllowAutomaticUpdates `Boolean`

Gets or sets a value indicating whether Telerik RadGrid will perform
            automatic updates to the data source.

#### Remarks
See Automatic Data Source
            Operations for details.

###  AllowCustomPaging `Boolean`

Gets or sets a value indicating whether custom paging should be performed instead
            of the integrated automatic paging.

#### Remarks
This online example demonstrates an approach to implementing custom paging with
                Telerik RadGrid. The simulated "DataLayer" wraps the logic of extracting records
                for only the specified page and deleting records. Telerik RadGrid
                maintains the pager buttons, changing of pager and other presentation specific
                features.Another available option for custom paging support is represented in the
                how-to
                section.Note: There is no universal mechanism for grouping when
                custom paging is allowed. The reason for this is that with the custom paging
                mechanism you fetch only part of the whole information from the grid datasource.
                Thus, when you trigger the grouping event the grid is restricted from operating
                with the whole available source data and is not able to group the items accurately.
                Furthermore, the aggregate functions as Count, Sum, etc. (covering operations with
                the whole set of grid items) will return incorrect results.A workaround solution for you could be to use hierarchy in the grid instead
                of grouping to single out the grid items logically and visually according to custom
                criteria. Thus you will be able to use custom paging without further
                limitations.Another approach is to build your own complex SQL statements which to get the
                whole available data from the grid datasource and then group the items in the grid
                with custom code logic.
                Finally, you can use standard paging instead of custom paging to ensure the
                consistency of the data on grouping.

###  AllowFilteringByColumn `Boolean`

Gets or sets a value indicating whether the filtering of all tables in the
            hierarchy will be enabled, unless specified other by
            GridTableView.AllowFilteringByColumn.

###  AllowMultiRowEdit `Boolean`

Gets or sets a value indicating whether Telerik RadGrid will allow
            you to have multiple rows in edit mode. The default value is
            false.

###  AllowMultiRowSelection `Boolean`

Gets or sets a value indicating whether you will be able to select multiple rows
            in Telerik RadGrid. By default this property is set to
            false.

#### Remarks
Note: You will not be able to select the Header, Footer or Pager
            rows.

###  AllowPaging `Boolean`

Gets or sets a value indicating whether the automatic paging feature is
             enabled.

#### Remarks
Instead of displaying all the records in the data source at the same time,
                 the Telerik RadGrid control can automatically break the records up into
                 pages. If the data source supports the paging capability, the
                 Telerik RadGrid control can take advantage of that and provide built-in
                 paging functionality. The paging feature can be used with any data source object
                 that supports the System.Collections.ICollection interface or a data source that
                 supports paging capability.To enable the paging feature, set the AllowPaging property
                 to true. By default, the Telerik RadGrid control
                 displays 10 records on a page at a time. You can change the number of records
                 displayed on a page by setting the PageSize property. To determine the total number
                 of pages required to display the data source contents, use the PageCount property.
                 You can determine the index of the currently displayed page by using the
                 CurrentPageIndex property.When paging is enabled, an additional item called the pager item is
                 automatically displayed in the Telerik RadGrid control. The pager item contains controls
                 that allow the user to navigate to the other pages. You can control the settings of
                 the pager item by using the PagerItemStyle property. The pager
                 item can be displayed at the top, bottom, or both the top and bottom of the control
                 by setting the Position property. You can also select from one of four built-in
                 pager display modes by setting the Mode property.The Telerik RadGrid control also allows you to define a custom
                 template for the pager item.

###  AllowSorting `Boolean`

Gets or sets a value indicating whether the sorting feature is enabled.

#### Remarks
When a data source control that supports sorting is bound to the
                 Telerik RadGrid control, the Telerik RadGrid control can
                 take advantage of the data source control's capabilities and provide automatic
                 sorting functionality.To enable sorting, set the AllowSorting property to
                 true. When sorting is enabled, the heading text for each column
                 field with its SortExpression property set is displayed as a link button.Clicking the link button for a column causes the items in the
                 Telerik RadGrid control to be sorted based on the sort expression.
                 Typically, the sort expression is simply the name of the field displayed in the
                 column, which causes the Telerik RadGrid control to sort with respect
                 to that column. To sort by multiple fields, use a sort expression that contains a
                 comma-separated list of field names. You can determine the sort expression that the
                 Telerik RadGrid control is applying by using the SortExpression
                 property. Clicking a column's link button repeatedly toggles the sort direction
                 between ascending and descending order.

###  AlternatingItemStyle `GridTableItemStyle`

Gets a reference to the GridTableItemStyle object that allows you to set the
             appearance of alternating data items in a Telerik RadGrid control.

#### Remarks
Use the AlternatingItemStyle property to control the appearance of
                 alternating data items in a Telerik RadGrid control. When this property
                 is set, the data items are displayed alternating between the ItemStyle settings and
                 the AlternatingItemStyle settings. This property is read-only; however, you can set
                 the properties of the GridTableItemStyle object it returns. The properties can be
                 set declaratively using one of the following methods:Place an attribute in the opening tag of the Telerik RadGrid
                     control in the form Property-Subproperty, where Subproperty is a property of
                     the GridTableItemStyle object (for example,
                     AlternatingItemStyle-ForeColor).Nest an <AlternatingItemStyle> element between the opening and
                     closing tags of the Telerik RadGrid control.The properties can also be set programmatically in the form
                 Property.Subproperty (for example, AlternatingItemStyle.ForeColor). Common settings
                 usually include a custom background color, foreground color, and font
                 properties.

###  AutoGenerateColumns `Boolean`

Gets or sets a value indicating whether bound fields are automatically created
             for each field in the data source.

#### Remarks
When the AutoGenerateColumns property is set to true, an
                 GridBoundColumn object is automatically created for each field in
                 the data source. Each field is then displayed as a column in the
                 Telerik RadGrid control in the order that the fields appear in the data
                 source. This option provides a convenient way to display every field in the data
                 source; however, you have limited control of how an automatically generated column
                 field is displayed or behaves.This set of columns can be accessed using the
                 AutoGeneratedColumns
                 collection.Runtime auto-generated columns will always appear after
                             the user-specified columns, unless the columns are ordered
                             programmatically.Instead of letting the Telerik RadGrid control automatically
                 generate the column fields, you can manually define the column fields by setting
                 the AutoGenerateColumns property to false and
                 then creating a custom Columns collection. In addition to bound column fields, you
                 can also display a button column, a check box column, a button column, a hyperlink
                 column, an image column, or a column based on your own custom-defined template
                 etc.

###  AutoGenerateDeleteColumn `Boolean`

Gets or sets a value determining if  will automatically
            generate a  with CommandName set to 'Delete'.

###  AutoGenerateEditColumn `Boolean`

Gets or sets a value determining if  will automatically
            generate a .

###  AutoGenerateHierarchy `Boolean`

Gets or sets a value indicating whether detail tables will be automatically created from the
            dataset object to which the grid is bound.

###  BackColor `Color`

Gets or sets the background color of the Web server control.

###  BackImageUrl `String`

Gets or sets the URL to an image to display in the background of a
            Telerik RadGrid control.

#### Remarks
Use the BackImageUrl property to specify the URL to an image
                to display in the background of a Telerik RadGrid control.If the specified image is smaller than the Telerik RadGrid
                control, the image is tiled to fill in the background. If the image is larger than
                the control, the image is cropped.

###  BorderColor `Color`

Gets or sets the border color of the Web control.

###  BorderStyle `BorderStyle`

Gets or sets the border style of the Web server control.

###  BorderWidth `Unit`

            The default value is changed to "AutoID".

###  ClientSettings `GridClientSettings`

Gets a reference to the  object that
                    allows you to set the properties of the client-side behavior and appearance in
                    a Telerik RadGrid control.

###  Columns `GridColumnCollection`

Gets a collection () of all columns in
                 Telerik RadGrid.

#### Remarks
This is one of the three columns collections in Telerik RadGrid. The
             other two are AutoGeneratedColumns and
             RenderColumns.

###  CommandItemStyle `GridTableItemStyle`

Gets a reference to the GridTableItemStyle object that allows you to set the
             appearance of the command item in a Telerik RadGrid control.

#### Remarks
Use the CommandItemStyle property to control the appearance of the command
                 item in a Telerik RadGrid control. This property is read-only; however,
                 you can set the properties of the GridTableItemStyle object it returns. The
                 properties can be set declaratively using one of the following methods:Place an attribute in the opening tag of the Telerik RadGrid
                     control in the form Property-Subproperty, where Subproperty is a property of
                     the GridTableItemStyle object (for example, CommandItemStyle-ForeColor).Nest a <CommandItemStyle> element between the opening and closing
                     tags of the Telerik RadGrid control.The properties can also be set programmatically in the form
                 Property.Subproperty (for example, CommandItemStyle.ForeColor). Common settings
                 usually include a custom background color, foreground color, and font
                 properties.

###  CssClass `String`

Gets or sets the Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) class rendered by the Web
            server control on the client.

###  CssClassFormatString `String`

The CssClass property will now be used instead of the former Skin
            and will be modified in AddAttributesToRender()

###  Culture `CultureInfo`

Gets or sets the selected culture. Localization strings will be loaded based on this value.

###  CurrentPageIndex `Int32`

Gets or sets an integer value representing the current page index.

#### Remarks
Note that the Paging must be enabled ( must
                be true) in order to use this property.

###  DataMember `String`

Gets or sets the name of the list of data that the Telerik RadGrid
            control binds to, in cases where the data source contains more than one distinct list
            of data items.

#### Remarks
Use the DataMember property to specify a member from a multimember data
                    source to bind to the list control. For example, if you have a data source with
                    more than one table specified in the DataSource
                    property, use the DataMember property to specify which table to bind to
                    a data listing control.
                The value of the DataMember property is stored in view state.This property cannot be set by themes or style sheet themes. For more
                information, see ThemeableAttribute and Themes and Skins
                Overview in MSDN.

###  DataMember `String`

Gets or sets the name of the list of data that the data-bound control
            binds to, in cases where the data source contains more than one distinct list
            of data items.

###  DataModelID `String`

Gets or sets a OData service DataModelID.

###  DataSource `Object`

Gets or sets the object from which the Telerik RadGrid control
            retrieves its list of data items.

#### Remarks
You should have in mind, that in case you are using simple data binding (i.e.
                when you are not using NeedDataSource event) the correct approach
                is to call the DataBind() method on the first page load when
                !Page.IsPostBack and after handling some event (sort event for
                example).You will need to assign DataSource and rebind the grid after
                each operation (paging, sorting, editing, etc.) - this copies exactly MS
                DataGrid behavior.

###  DataSource `Object`

Gets or sets the object from which the data-bound control retrieves
            its list of data items.

###  DataSourceID `Object`

Gets or sets the ID of the control from which the Telerik RadGrid
                 control retrieves its list of data items.

#### Remarks
If the Telerik RadGrid control has already been initialized when
                 you set the DataSourceID property.This property cannot be set by themes or style sheet themes.

###  DataSourceID `Object`

Gets or sets the ID of the control from which the data-bound control
            retrieves its list of data items.

###  DeleteMethod `String`

Gets or sets the name of the method to call in order to delete data

###  EditIndexes `GridIndexCollection`

Gets a collection of the indexes of the Items that are in edit mode.

###  EditItems `GridDataItemCollection`

Gets a collection of all GridItems in edit mode. See the Remarks
            for more info.

#### Remarks
The EditItems collection contains InPlace
                edit mode items. When you switch the edit type to EditForms, the
                EditItems collection holds the currently edited items but not
                their EditFormItems (which in this case hold the new values). See
                this help article for more
                details.
                    You should not use this property to check whether there are items in edit mode.
                    The better approach is to use  property instead.

###  EditItemStyle `GridTableItemStyle`

Gets a reference to the GridTableItemStyle object that allows you to set the
             appearance of the item selected for editing in a Telerik RadGrid
             control.

#### Remarks
Use the EditItemStyle property to control the appearance of the item being
                 edited in a Telerik RadGrid control. This property is read-only;
                 however, you can set the properties of the GridTableItemStyle object it returns.
                 The properties can be set declaratively using one of the following methods:Place an attribute in the opening tag of the Telerik RadGrid
                     control in the form Property-Subproperty, where Subproperty is a property of
                     the GridTableItemStyle object (for example, EditItemStyle-ForeColor).Nest a <EditItemStyle> element between the opening and closing tags
                     of the Telerik RadGrid control.The properties can also be set programmatically in the form
                 Property.Subproperty (for example, EditItemStyle.ForeColor). Common settings
                 usually include a custom background color, foreground color, and font
                 properties.

###  EnableAjaxSkinRendering `String`

            execute requested operation.

#### Remarks
If you set a value that is greater than the actual number of items, RadGrid
                will show all available items plus empty pages (or whatever other content you set)
                for the items that exceed the actual number.For example you have a data source with 9'000 items and you set
                VirtualItemCount to 10'000. If your page size is 1000, the grid will render 10
                pages and the last page will be empty (or with NoRecordsTemplate if you're using
                such).

###  Visible `Boolean`

            as UI on the page.

###  Width `Unit`

Gets or sets the width of the Web server control.

###  Width `Unit`

## Methods

###  ApplyConditionalRendering

Use this from RenderContents of the inheritor

#### Returns

`System.Void` 

###  CloseEditItems

When there is a hierarchy and when AllowMultiRowEdit is false this method should close all edit items (put them out of edit mode)
            except the last one. We need to do this later in the page lifecycle to prevent viewstate-related issues when the edit mode is inplace
            and when there are databound controls in the editors. Original problem affected GridDropDownColumn (in both Combo and DropDown mode)
            and GridAutoComplete columns.

#### Returns

`System.Void` 

###  ControlPreRender

Code moved into this method from OnPreRender to make sure it executed when the framework skips OnPreRender() for some reason

#### Returns

`System.Void` 

###  CreateTableView

This method is used by RadGrid internally. Please do not use.

#### Returns

`Telerik.Web.UI.GridTableView` 

###  DataBind

Data-bind %MasterTableView% and its detail
                %GridTableView%s. Prior to calling DataBind, the
                %DataSource% property should be assigned.

#### Remarks
You should have in mind, that in case you are using simple data binding (i.e.
                when you are not using NeedDataSource event) the correct approach
                is to call the DataBind() method on the first page load when
                !Page.IsPostBack and after handling some event (sort event for
                example).You will need to assign DataSource and rebind the grid after
                each operation (paging, sorting, editing, etc.) - this copies exactly MS
                DataGrid behavior.
                    We recommend using the  method instead and handling
                    the  event.

###  GetBindingData

Gets a  object that could be used when binding a  control
            to a service. The GetBindingData method have many overrides and their main purpose is to return
            a object to be used and returned from a service so a  control could handle complex operations
            like sorting, filtering, paging. In the general case the parameters are automatically passed when the 
            makes a request to the service. However, you could use it for custom scenarios by providing your manually generated
            parameters.
