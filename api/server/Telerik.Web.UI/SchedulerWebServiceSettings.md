###  ResourcePopulationMode `SchedulerResourcePopulationMode`

Gets or sets the resource population mode
                   to be used from RadScheduler.

#### Remarks
Resources need to be populated from the server when using resource grouping.
                   Doing so also reduces the client-side initialization time.
            
                   This operation requires the WebPermission to be granted
                   for the Web Service URL. This permission is not granted by default in Medium Trust.
            
                   You can disable the population of the resources from the server and still use
                   client-side rendering for grouped views. To do so you need to set the
                   value to Manual and
                   populate the resources from the OnInit method of the page.

###  UpdateAppointmentMethod `String`

###  UpdateMode `AppointmentUpdateMode`

#### Remarks
Using Batch results in updating all appointments per
            single operation. On the other hand, Single
            mode updates only the appointment that was edited, hence reducing the bandwidth usage.

###  UseHttpGet `Boolean`

Gets or sets a boolean value
