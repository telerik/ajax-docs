Field which is part of each P:Telerik.Web.UI.GridGroupByExpression.SelectFields and P:Telerik.Web.UI.GridGroupByExpression.GroupByFields collection

#### Remarks
Some of the GridGroupByField properties are meaningful only when present under
                 specific collection - P:Telerik.Web.UI.GridGroupByExpression.SelectFields or
                 P:Telerik.Web.UI.GridGroupByExpression.GroupByFields

## Inheritance Hierarchy

## Properties

###  Aggregate `GridAggregateFunction`

Gets or sets aggregate function (from 
                 enumeration values) that will be applied on the grouped data.

#### Remarks
Meaningful only for fields in the
                  collection.

###  FieldAlias `String`

Gets or sets a value representing a friendly name for the field used for forming
             the group by expression. This name will be displayed in each group header when grouping
             by the respective field.

#### Remarks
Use this property for setting the field text that will be displayed in the
                     GridGroupHeaderItem. If this property is not set, the value of
                      property will be used. Note that this property has
                     a meaning only for GridGroupByField part of the SelectFields of
                     GridGroupByExpression.
                 This property is useful in cases when:you want to change the value displayed in group header (different than
                     the default DataField column value)
                     orgroup by a template column and Telerik RadGrid cannot get the
                     header text for that column.

###  FieldName `String`

Gets or sets a string that represents the DataField column
             property that will be used to form the GroupByExpression.

#### Remarks
Unless you have specified a FieldAlias, the value of this
             property will be used when Telerik RadGrid constructs the text for
             GridGroupHeaderItem. FieldName has a meaning both for
             SelectFields and GroupByFields of
             GroupByExpression.

###  FormatString `String`

Gets or sets the string that will be used to format the GridGroupByField part of
                 the  collection.

#### Remarks
Meaningful only for fields in the
                      collection.
                 When rendering RadGrid is using this expression to format field's value. It
                 is mandatory that {0} parameter is specified in the string - it will be replaced
                 with field's runtime value.

###  HeaderText `String`

Gets or sets the expression that will be displayed in the
                 .

#### Remarks
Meaningful only for fields in the
                  collection. When rendering
                 RadGrid will override the FieldAlias value with the
                 HeaderText specified.

###  HeaderValueSeparator `String`

Gets or sets the string that separates header text from value text as the
                 field is rendered in the GroupHeaderItems.

#### Remarks
Meaningful only for fields in the
                  collection.

###  SortOrder `GridSortOrder`

Gets or sets the value representing how the data will be sorted. Acceptable values
                 are the values of  enumeration except for None
                 (Ascending, Descending).

#### Remarks
Meaningful only for fields in the
                  collection. 'None' value is
                 not supported because it can not determine uniquely the order in which the groups
                 will be displayed.
