# Telerik.Web.UI.RadScheduler

Using the Telerik RadScheduler control, you can build powerful ASP.NET
            applications to allow users to create and manage tasks. RadScheduler displays
            and edits scheduled appointments that are stored in a separate data source. A variety
            of data binding options allows you to work with data sources that
            are as simple or as powerful as you want.
