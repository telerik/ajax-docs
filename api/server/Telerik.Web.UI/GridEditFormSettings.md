# Telerik.Web.UI.GridEditFormSettings

Settings for the edit forms generated by a Telerik.Web.UI.GridTableView for each item that is in edit mode and the
            P:Telerik.Web.UI.GridTableView.EditMode is set to F:Telerik.Web.UI.GridEditMode.EditForms .

#### Remarks
Set the type of the EditForm using P:Telerik.Web.UI.GridEditFormSettings.EditFormType .
            If the type is F:Telerik.Web.UI.GridEditFormType.AutoGenerated then the form will be autogenerated based on the
            columns of the corresponding table view. Note that only the columns that are editable wil be included. Those are
            the standatrd columns that have editing capabilities - such Telerik.Web.UI.GridBoundColumn that has
            P:Telerik.Web.UI.GridEditableColumn.ReadOnly set to false. All the style properties apply only to the autogenerated edit form.
            See Telerik.Web.UI.GridEditFormType for more details on the types of the edit forms.

#### Remarks
You have two options regarding the implementation of the web user control depending on the
             desired mode of exchanging data between Telerik RadGrid and the UserControl instances.
             As the binding container of the edit form is a GridEditFormItem and UserControl is a binding container iteself too,
             in order to access data from the object currently the edit form is binding to
             the binding-expressions used in the UserControl should be implemented in a slightly different then the traditional way.
             Here is an example of declaration of a TextBox server control that should be bound to the Region property
             of the DataItem in RadGrid:
             
             <asp:TextBox id="TextBox1" runat="server" Text='<%# DataBinder.Eval( Container, "Parent.BindingContainer.DataItem.Region") %>;' />
             
             The container object is always the UserControl isself. That is why you should refer the parent
             object, which is actually a edit for table cell in the grid's . Then
             the BindingContainer would refer the binding GridEditFormItem instance.
            
             If using this kind of expression seems in some way uncorfotable, you have another option.
             You user control should implement a property with name DataItem. The type of the propertry
             should be public and assignable from the type of the object that construct the data-source for RadGrid.
             For example if you bind to a DataSet then the DataItem can be declared as:
             c#:
             
            
             private DataRowView _dataItem = null;
            
                public DataRowView DataItem
                {
                    get
                    {
                        return this._dataItem;
                    }
                    set
                    {
                        this._dataItem = value;
                    }
             }
             
            
             VB.NET
             
             private _dataItem As DataRowView = Nothing
            
                Public Property DataItem As DataRowView
                    Get
                        Return Me._dataItem
                    End Get
                    Set (ByVal value As DataRowView)
                        Me._dataItem = value
                    End Set
             End Property
             
            
             DataItem can also be declared as of type object.
            
             Then in the usercontrol code, an expression binding the text of a TextBox control
             to the Country property of the datasource item can be declared this way:
             
             <asp:TextBox id="TextBox1" runat="server" Text='<%# DataBinder.Eval( Container, "DataItem.Country"  ) %>'>
             </asp:TextBox>
