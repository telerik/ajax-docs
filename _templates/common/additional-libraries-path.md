#additional-libraries-path
You can find @{assemblies} in the **AdditionalLibraries** folder in the **Telerik® UI for ASP.NET AJAX** installation (automated and manual) and in the internal builds archive. @{support} .NET 4 and .NET 4.5, so depending on the target framework of your project, you need to take the @{isplural} from the *Bin40* or *Bin45* folder respectively.
