## SPRadScheduler Settings Tool Pane

Telerik SPRadScheduler WebPart comes with a tool-part menu for changing the control data source as well as switching on/off SPRadScheduler's most important capabilities. The tool-part is shown through the "Edit Web Part" option on the web part menu.

The tool-part features four custom property-setting tool panes:

* Scheduler Data tool pane allows setting and configuring the data source of the control.
