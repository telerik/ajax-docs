# Web Content Management Scenario



Telerik RadEditor for SharePoint 2010 can be easily used as a cross-browser rich-text editor for Web Content Management in SharePoint 2010. In order to replace the default editor in a page template, you need to perform a one-time modification using SharePoint Designer 2010. All content which has been authored through the default editor will be preserved and accessible through the Telerik RadEditor for SharePoint 2010.

## Enabling RadEditor for WCM Scenarios

>note  **NOTE:** Once the RadEditor for SharePoint 2010 features are activated, they will affect only the current site. You need to activate the RadEditor features for each site individually. If you want to change the scope of the features, see the following article - [Change the RadEditor features scope]({%slug sharepoint/2010/radeditor-web-part/configuration/change-the-radeditor-features-scope%})



1. From the **Site Actions** menu go to **Site Settings**

4. **IMPORTANT!** If you still see the default editor or a simple textbox after you activate the RadEditor feature(s), you might need to open a command prompt window and type **`iisreset`** to reset the Internet Information Server. This will prevent problems caused by caching.

* At the top, after the default SharePoint Register tags add the following registration line (replace `Version=x.x.x.x` with the RadEditor for SharePoint 2010 version, e.g., for editor v6.00 use Version=6.0.0.0):

	**ASP.NET**

		<%@ Register TagPrefix="telerik" Namespace="Telerik.SharePoint.FieldEditor" Assembly="RadEditorSharePoint, Version=x.x.x.x, culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=1f131a624888eeed" %>


	>caption Figure 6: Adding a Register directive for the RadEditor control.

	![sp 2010-register-rad-editor](images/sp2010-register-rad-editor.png)

* Replace the tag of the default editor **`<PublishingWebControls:RichHtmlField ... >`** with the RadEditor tag:

	**ASP.NET**

		<telerik:RadHtmlField id="Content" FieldName="..." runat="server">
		</telerik:RadHtmlField>
