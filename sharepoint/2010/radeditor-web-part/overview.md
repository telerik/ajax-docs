Thank you for choosing Telerik RadEditor for SharePoint!

RadEditor for Microsoft Office SharePoint Server extends the web content authoring environment of SharePoint 2007/2010 by providing cross-browser compatibility and support for the Apple Mac OS platform. In the default configuration, the product offers an almost identical functionality level as the integrated rich-text editor and can be used in the following scenarios:

* Rich-text field control in SharePoint forms (in Lists, Wikis, Blogs, etc.)

* Content editor Web Part

**Important details:**

* Greatly improved loading speed

* New semantic rendering

* Industry-best cross-browser support
