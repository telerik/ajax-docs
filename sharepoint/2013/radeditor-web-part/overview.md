# RadEditor Web Part Overview




![](images/EditorLogoPr.gif)

Thank you for choosing Telerik RadEditor for SharePoint!

RadEditor for Microsoft Office SharePoint Server extends the web content authoring environment of SharePoint 2013 by providing cross-browser compatibility and support for the Apple Mac OS platform. In the default configuration, the product offers an almost identical functionality level as the integrated rich-text editor and can be used in the following scenarios:

* Rich-text field control in SharePoint forms (in Wikis, Blogs, etc.)

* Content editor Web Part

* Rich-HTML field in Web Content Management (publishing) scenarios

>note The option for using the RadEditor to edit list items is not supported in the SharePoint Web Parts for ASP.NET AJAX for SharePoint 2013, because the template for thelist items' edit field in SharePoint 2013 is implemented entirely on the client, while the RadEditor is a server-side control.



**Important details:**

RadEditor for SharePoint is a modified version of the Telerik RadEditor control and it is built on top of the RadEditor for ASP.NET AJAX. The tight integration with ASP.NET AJAX and powerful new capabilities of the suite features the new WYSIWYG Editor as a flexible and lightweight component. Among the hottest features are:

* Greatly improved loading speed

* Decreased script size

* New semantic rendering

* Industry-best cross-browser support

* Multilevel undo/redo with Action Trails

* AJAX-Based File Browser Dialogs

* Full keyboard accessibility

* Simplified and intuitive toolbar configuration

* Ability to have editors with different skins on the same page
