# Supported SharePoint App Models



## 

The SharePoint 2013 Apps are divided into several types, depending on where they are hosted. The following list contains information about each type and whether Telerik® UI for ASP.NET AJAX support it:

* **Provider-hosted (supported)** - Developer or IT department provides the hosting structure for the application, so there is no limitation for the technology that can be used, including Telerik® UI for ASP.NET AJAX.

* **Autohosted (supported)** - The application is hosted in Windows Azure. In general Telerik® UI for ASP.NET AJAX support Azure.

* **SharePoint-hosted (not supported)** - This kind of app lives entirely in the client’s SharePoint environment and it is limited to using only HTML and JavaScript. Telerik® UI for ASP.NET AJAX depend on server rendering, so this scenario is not supported. You may use Kendo UI widgets.
