# Composite Controls 


//TODO hiiid emee as well :)

When working with complex controls (e.g. RadGrid, RadScheduler, etc.) the nested components will be included automatically. Thus, you can easily configure the complete look and feel of the composite control.

>note Note that if one of the nested controls is used separately on the page you should set its **Skin** explicitly. To use a custom skin you should also ensure that the **EnableEmbeddedSkins** property is set to **false**.

An example for a composite control is the Scheduler control. For illustration we will start making a custom theme for it.

After you click on the **Create** button you will notice that there are additional controls available for styling. In this case a **Calendar** and a **DateTimePicker** controls. This is because they are included in the Scheduler.

The theme customization process is the same as the one described in the **Create and Download** article.
