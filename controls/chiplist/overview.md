# ChipList Overview

The ChipList is a container for two or more individual [Chip]({%slug chip/overview%}) components. They represent a complex piece of information in a compact form—for example, an entity that can be a person, a place, or a thing. 

Each chip item from the list can be selected or removed and supports various styling options. The ChipList component is commonly used for single or multiple selections such as additions to an ordered meal. This component is a server-side, ASP.NET WebForms wrapper over the [Kendo UI ChipList widget](https://docs.telerik.com/kendo-ui/controls/chiplist/overview).
