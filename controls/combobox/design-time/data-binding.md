# Data Binding



## 

You can bind RadComboBox to a Data Source and configure its Data Bindings entirely in Design Time through the Smart Tag.

Once the Data Source has been chosen from the Smart Tag, additional dropdown fields will show - __DataTextField__and __DataValueField__. You need to choose the fields in the Data Source which will serve data respectively for the __Text__ and __Value__ properties of the RadComboBox Items.
