# Set Caret Position at the Beginning of the Input in IE



## 

By default when an item is selected, the input of the RadComboBox is focused and the caret is positoned at the end of the selected item's text. This could be a problem when the text of the item exceeds the width of the input, since you are seeing only the end of the text. There is a very easy workaround for this behavior shown below:

>note Please note that this behavior only occurs in IE, so there is no need of the workaround in the other browsers.
