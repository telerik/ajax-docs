# Radial

The **RadRadialGauge** represents the ranges and the value in a circular format, much like a car dashboard.In a similar manner it offers a customizable dial and a pointer, that rotates around its cap to show the value on the scale. For example:

![gauge-radial-gauge-thermometer-example](images/gauge-radial-gauge-thermometer-example.png)

To get a better idea which element corresponds to which tag check the [RadGauge Structure]({%slug gauge/radgauge-structure%}) article.The above gauge was created with the following simple markup:

````ASP.NET
<telerik:RadRadialGauge runat="server" ID="RadRadialGauge1" Height="350px" Width="350px">
	<Pointer Value="220" Color="Black">
		<Cap Color="Gray" Size="0.1" />
	</Pointer>
	<Scale Min="120" Max="300" MajorUnit="30" MinorUnit="5">
	<Labels Format="{0} &deg;C" Position="Outside" />
		<Ranges>
			<telerik:GaugeRange Color="Orange" From="150" To="190" />
			<telerik:GaugeRange Color="Green" From="190" To="230" />
			<telerik:GaugeRange Color="Red" From="230" To="300" />
		</Ranges>
	</Scale>
</telerik:RadRadialGauge>

The control offers more customization options than the ones shown above:

* **Advanced pointer customizations** - The arrow is customizable in terms of **Value** and **Color**. The **Cap** (the axis around which the arrow rotates) offers the **Color** and **Size** properties. The size is a percentage of the whole dial and its value must be between [0;1].

* **Basic Scale configuration** - the **Scale** is the main wrapper of the control and details are configurable through inner properties. The main **Scale** tag, however, offers the basic functionality - the **Min** and **Max** values of the gauge, the **MajorUnit** and **MinorUnit** properties that control the ticks and label distance,and the **Reverse** property which shows the higher values first when set to true. The specific properties here are**StartAngle** and **EndAngle** which control the angle from which the gauge's dial starts and at which it ends.The difference between them must be less than 360 degrees and they can also take negative values so that the gauge rotates from the default vertical centring. The **zero angle** is horizontal to the left.

* **Labels configuration** - you can choose the **BackgroundColor, Color and Font** to customize their appearance.The **Visible** property controls if they are shown and the **Format** takes a format string that will be applied to the text according to the value. The format string uses the **{0}** placeholder to indicate the value.The **Template** property is a client template similar to the format - it takes a similar string to show in the labels,but the value placeholder is **#=value#**. The **Position** property controls whether the labels are inside or outside of the dial.

* **Ticks configuration** - the **MajorTicks** and **MinorTicks** inner tags expose the small lines that protrude from the ranges to show the value. They can be customized in terms of **Color**, **Size** or **Width** (in pixels) and **Visibility** (boolean).

* **Ranges configuration** - the **Ranges** tag contains several **GaugeRange** tags that represent the areas of the gauge that will show differently than the regular scale. Each range has the **From** and **To** properties that control is positioning on the scale and also the **Color** property that can be used to specify their fill.

* **Main gauge configuration** - the **Appearance** tag of the control allows for customizing its entire look. Currently it offers the **BackgroundColor** property which sets the wrapper's background fill.
