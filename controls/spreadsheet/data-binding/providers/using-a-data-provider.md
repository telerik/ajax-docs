# Using a Data Provider



**RadSpreadsheet** follows the Provider Design Pattern to allow for easy integration into existing applications. On the Microsoft Web site, the article [Introduction To the Provider Model](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa479030.aspx) provides a detailed introduction to understanding this pattern.

You can use one of the providers supplied in the Telerik.Web.UI assembly, or you can implement your own.

The Telerik.Web.UI assembly defines the **Telerik.Web.UI.SpreadsheetDocumentProvider** provider, which can be used to bind the **RadSpreadsheet** to the most common excel file formats. The provider uses the [RadSpreadProcessing library](http://docs.telerik.com/devtools/aspnet-ajax/controls/spreadprocessing/overview) internally.

To bind **RadSpreadsheet** to a provider, you can either set its **Provider** property at runtime, or set the **ProviderName** property declaratively.

## Binding to a provider declaratively

The following steps show how to declaratively bind **RadSpreadsheet** to the **Telerik.Web.UI.SpreadsheetDocumentProvider**, using the **ProviderName** property.

* Using the Solution Explorer, double click on the Web.config file. Locate the `<configSections>` tag at the very top. **RadSpreadsheet** is designed to be used with providers configured in a custom section of the web.config file. The custom section requires a handler that is included in the Telerik.Web.UI assembly. Add a `<section>` for this handler to the `<configSections>` of your Web.config file:

````XML
	
<configSections>
	<sectionGroup name="telerik.web.ui">
		<section name="radSpreadsheet"
			type="Telerik.Web.UI.RadSpreadsheetConfigurationSection,
					Telerik.Web.UI, PublicKeyToken=121fae78165ba3d4"
			allowDefinition="MachineToApplication" />
	</sectionGroup>
</configSections>

````

* Now that you have declared a handler, add the `<telerik.web.ui>` section to your Web.config file (if it is not already there), and in the <telerik.web.ui> section, declare the provider:

````XML

<radSpreadsheet defaultProvider="Integrated">
	<providers>
		<add name="SpreadsheetDocumentProvider1"
			type="Telerik.Web.UI.SpreadsheetDocumentProvider"
			fileName="~/App_Data/Spreadsheet.xlsx" />
	</providers>
</radSpreadsheet>     

````

* Now that the provider will be loaded into your application, set the **ProviderName** property of the **RadSpreadsheet** to "SpreadsheetDocumentProvider1".

````ASP.NET

<telerik:RadSpreadsheet runat="server" ID="RadSpreadsheet1"
	ProviderName="SpreadsheetDocumentProvider1">
</telerik:RadSpreadsheet>

````

* Create an Excel file called "Spreadsheet.xlsx", and copy it to the App_Data folder of your project.


You have now bound your **RadSpreadsheet** using the **ProviderName** property.

>tip The PublicKeyToken in step 1. varies in different versions on RadControls. You can use [JustDecompile](http://www.telerik.com/products/decompiler.aspx), to see the PublicKeyToken for your version. Additionally, if the assembly is added to your GAC, you can see its Public Key Token there as well.
>

## Binding to a provider at runtime

Binding the **RadSpreadsheet** to a provider at runtime requires only one step:

* Set the **Provider** property in the code behind, assigning it an instance of the **Telerik.Web.UI.SpreadsheetDocumentProvider** class, with the path to the excel file as a parameter.   

````ASP.NET

<telerik:RadSpreadsheet runat="server" ID="RadSpreadsheet1">
</telerik:RadSpreadsheet>

````

````C#

protected void Page_Init(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
	RadSpreadSheet1.Provider = new SpreadsheetDocumentProvider(Server.MapPath("~/App_Data/Spreadsheet.xlsx"));
}
	
````
````VB.NET
	
Protected Sub Page_Init(sender As Object, e As EventArgs)
	RadSpreadSheet1.Provider = New SpreadsheetDocumentProvider(Server.MapPath("~/App_Data/Spreadsheet.xlsx"))
End Sub
	
````

You have now bound your **RadSpreadsheet** using the **Provider** property at runtime.
