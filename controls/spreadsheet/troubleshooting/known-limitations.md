* **Paste using the context menu or the toolbar buttons does not work in Chrome, Firefox and Edge.**

	This is a browser limitation. The user cannot paste content in a **RadSpreadsheet** cell using the control's context menu or the buttons on the toolbar of the control. Instead the keyboard command Ctrl+V / Cmd+V should be used.
