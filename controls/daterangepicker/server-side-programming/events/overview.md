# Server-side events Overview

The **RadDateRangePicker** controls expose the following server-side event:

 * [RangeSelectionChanged]({%slug daterangepicker/server-side-programming/events/rangeselectionchanged%}) occurs when the user changes the value of the control, either when control area loses focus after the user has typed a new value, or when the user selects a new value in the popup calendar or time view control.


>note In order for the server-side events to be fired the **RadDateRangePicker** should trigger postback. You need to set the **AutoPostBack** property to **true**.
