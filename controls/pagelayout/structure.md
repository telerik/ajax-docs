The **RadPageLayout** control is a really simple and light-weight control for creating layouts. With the proper configuration it becomes a powerful layout tool that's addressing both desktop and mobile device design. This help article describes the main elements of the **RadPageLayout** control - the basic markup that you need to have on the page to build the control. You can also find information on the rendering of the control container, the **LayoutRow** and the **CompositeLayoutColumn** (the composite elements of the **RadPageLayout**).
