# PageLayout Overview



The **RadPageLayout** control is a really simple and light-weight control for creating layouts. With the proper configuration it becomes a powerful layout tool that addresses both desktop and mobile device design. It is specially designed to help you adapt your page look good regardless of the device that you use â€“ this includes extra large, large, medium, small or extra small devices.

## Elements

Modeled after a [grid ]({%slug pagelayout/creating-responsive-design/grid-based-layout-%}) system, the **RadPageLayout** control has only two elements - rows and columns. Using those you can create grid-like wireframes that can then fill with content.

* [Rows]({%slug pagelayout/structure/rows%}) - The rows are simple containers for columns. They also have an additional placeholder element (`<Content>`) for own content. A row has no own specific properties, only the standard ones.

* [Columns]({%slug pagelayout/structure/columns-%}) - The column is the structural unit of design. If you are not familiar with grid systems, you can view them as a sort of table cell (but not quite).

>tip The span attribute sets the size (or width) of a columns, measured grid units. The grid unit itself is an abstract unit and represents fraction of the total container width. In the case of this control, one grid unit equals 1/12 of the total width. **Therefore the sum of the values for all spans in a single row can be up to 12 units** .
>
In addition to the standard properties, a column has few specific properties that are covered in the [Columns ]({%slug pagelayout/structure/columns-%}) help article.

## Properties

**RadPageLayout** control provides two sets of properties:

* **Global** properties that can be applied to the control container, rows and columns.

* **Specific** properties that are applied only on the control container or columns.

Global properties are **HtmlTag**, visibility properties (see [Responsive Layout]({%slug pagelayout/creating-responsive-design/responsive-layout%}) topic for more details), **StaticId**, as well as inherited properties such as **CssClass**, **ID** etc. We use properties to extend the rendering of the control. For instance, the **HtmlTag** property, as the name suggests, changes the HTML element that is going to be rendered for that server-side control. The **StaticId** property specifies the actual rendered Id attribute and so on.

## Putting it All Together

To jumpstart building layouts, you need only one attribute - the span attribute. It specify how wide a column is in terms of grid units. (See [Grid Based Layout ]({%slug pagelayout/creating-responsive-design/grid-based-layout-%}) help topic for more details on grids and grid based layouts).
