# WebForms ListBox Overview

**RadListBox** is a powerful ASP.NET AJAX control to display a list of items. It allows for multiple selection of items, [reorder]({%slug listbox/functionality/reorder%}) and [transfer]({%slug listbox/functionality/transfer%}) between two RadListBox controls. [Drag and drop]({%slug listbox/functionality/drag-and-drop%}) is fully supported as well. You can easily control the appearance by [arranging the buttons]({%slug listbox/functionality/button-settings%}) in different layouts or [changing their text]({%slug listbox/accessibility-and-internationalization/localization%}). [Icons and checkboxes]({%slug listbox/functionality/adding-images-and-checkboxes-to-items%}) are also supported within RadListBox items. **RadListBox** implements a highly efficient semantic rendering, which uses list items and CSS instead of tables. As a result the HTML output is significantly reduced, which dramatically improves performance.

**RadListBox** can be bound to all ASP.NET [declarative datasources]({%slug listbox/data-binding/binding-to-asp.net-datasource-components%}) (ObjectDataSource, XmlDataSource, SqlDataSource, etc) as well as the ASP.NET [LinqDataSource]({%slug listbox/data-binding/binding-to-asp.net-datasource-components%}) and [EntityDataSource]({%slug listbox/data-binding/binding-to-asp.net-datasource-components%}). [Binding to XML strings]({%slug listbox/radlistbox-items/loading-items-from-xml%}) as well as [automatic database updates]({%slug listbox/data-binding/automatic-database-updates%}) are fully supported.

**RadListBox** has a [rich client-side API]({%slug listbox/client-side-programming/objects/radlistbox-object%}) and [comprehensive set of events]({%slug listbox/client-side-programming/events/overview%}) guaranteeing full control over various functions performed on the client. You can easily [add/delete/update]({%slug listbox/client-side-programming/objects/radlistboxitemcollection-object%}) items at the client side and all the changes will be persisted on the server as well. The rich client-side API provides unbeatable performance and desktop-like experience.

**RadListBox** is shipped with a rich set of [skins]({%slug listbox/appearance-and-styling/skins%}) that allow you to easily build slick interfaces with the look-and-feel of Windows Vista, Office 2007, Outlook, etc. The skins can be easily switched using a single property.
