# Specifying the Initial State

By default, when the page first loads, all of the sliding panes in a sliding zone are collapsed. Two properties let you change this default behavior so that the sliding zone starts with one of its sliding panes expanded to show its content:

* Set the **DockedPaneId** property of the **RadSlidingZone** control to the **ID** property of one of its sliding panes to cause the sliding zone to load with that pane expanded and docked.

	>tip The **EnableDock** property of the sliding pane must be **True** , or the **DockedPaneId** property of the parent zone has no effect.


* Set the **ExpandedPaneId** property of the **RadSlidingZone** control to the ID property of one of its sliding panes to cause the sliding zone to load with that pane expanded but not docked.
