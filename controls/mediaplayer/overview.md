# WebForms MediaPlayer Overview



 

Q3 2013 release of UI for ASP.NET AJAX introduces the highly requested RadMediaPlayer - a video/audio player supporting HTML5 media formats and offering tight integration with media providers, such as YouTube.

RadMediaPlayer uses the build-in HTML5 `<video>` and `<audio>` element functionality to bring powerful media capabilities to your apps without the necessity of installing additional plug-ins. It provides a quick and easy to setup way to deliver rich media web experience for websites, blogs, online TV channels, e-commerce pages, etc.

##   

Due to a recent change in the script of the player, from last year onward it will render as an <object> for FLV videos even on modern browsers supporting HTML5. That way, the customer is now able to provide single FLV video and let the player handle the rest.
