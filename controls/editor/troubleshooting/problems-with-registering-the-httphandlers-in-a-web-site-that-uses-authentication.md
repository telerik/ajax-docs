# Problems with Registering the HttpHandlers in a Web Site that Uses Authentication

In a form authentication scenario a non-logged user is redirected to the login page.When a non-logged user loads any **RadEditor** dialog, the ASP.NET Framework tries to load the login screen in the dialog. As a result an error which alerts that the **HttpHandler** of the dialog is not registered is thrown.

To ensure that the HttpHandler of the **RadEditor** dialog is always accessible, you should add the following two **location** entries to the web.config:

````XML
<configuration>
	<location path="Telerik.Web.UI.DialogHandler.aspx">
		<system.web>
			<authorization>
				<allow roles="*"/>
			</authorization>
		</system.web>
	</location>
	<location path="Telerik.Web.UI.SpellCheckHandler.axd">
		<system.web>
			<authorization>
				<allow roles="*"/>
			</authorization>
		</system.web>
	</location>
</configuration>
````
