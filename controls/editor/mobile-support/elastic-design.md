# Elastic Design

This article explains the **elastic design capabilities RadEditor offers**.	The example below shows the simple approach you can use to scale the control by only changing its default font size.

>note The elastic design capabilities in the RadEditor control are available only when [RenderMode]({%slug editor/mobile-support/render-modes%}) is set to *Lightweight* .

**RadEditor** does not create elastic design by itself, but can fit in a page that follows this pattern.This means that you can change its font size without breaking the control's appearance - if the new size is larger than the original,the elements in the control will simply increase their size.This fluid layout is achieved by using `em` units for setting dimensions and paddings in the control,instead of `px` because em units are tied to the font size.This allows dimensions and sizes to scale with the font size.
