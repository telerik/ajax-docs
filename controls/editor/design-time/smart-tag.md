# Smart Tag

The Smart Tag of **RadEditor** lets you configure your control or quickly get help. You can display	the Smart Tag by right clicking on a **RadEditor** control and choosing "Show Smart Tag", or clicking the small rightward-pointing arrow located in the upper right corner of the control. You can see how the Smart Tag opened in **Figure 1**.

As of Q2 2015 we have improved the smart tags of our controls by displaying the most popular control specific properties and adding links to their important online resources:
