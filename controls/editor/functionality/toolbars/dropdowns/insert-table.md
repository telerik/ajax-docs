# Insert Table

RadEditor offers two ways for creating tables. The best approach depends on your preferences and the table complexity:

* For simple tables we recommend the click-and-drag Table Builder 

* For more complex tables, the Table Wizard is more appropriate.

## Table Wizard

The Table Wizard provides advanced features for creating and customizing tables in the editor's content area. The Table Wizard is a dialog with tabs for detailed table design: **Table Properties, Cell Properties and Accessibility**. The Table Wizard can be invoked using the **Insert Table Dropdown**.

## Table Properties

This tab allows you to adjust the number of rows and columns as well as adjust the row and column span. You can also configure table dimensions and layout by setting one or more of the following table properties:

* **Cell spacing** - Increases or decreases the space between the borders of the cells.

* **Cell padding** - Increases or decreases the space between the content and the border of a cell.

* **Alignment** - Aligns the table to the left, center or right side of the page.

* **Back Color** - Sets the background color of the table.

* **CSS Class** - Styles the entire table by using a predefined layout. For more information see the [Table Properties CSS Class Layout toolOnline Demo](https://demos.telerik.com/aspnet-ajax/editor/examples/tablelayoutcssfile/defaultcs.aspx).

## Cell Properties

The Cell Properties tab allows you to fine-tune the appearance of individual cells of a given table. Here you can configure cell width, height, alignment, background, the cell ID, toggle text wrapping and set the CSS class for a given cell.
