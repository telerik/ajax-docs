# Automatic Height Resize

The value of the **AutoResizeHeight** property indicates whether the RadEditor will auto-resize its height to match content height.

This property is similar to the **Overflow** property of the DIV element, which is not supported by the IFRAME elements. When the **AutoResizeHeight** property is set to **true**, then the editor's content area is resizing to match content height and no scrollbars will appear.
