# Inline and Block Commands Behavior Change

## What Has Been Changed

During the last few years, the editor got many new important features and functionalities. All these goodies highly increased the end-user’s usability and support for different scenarios, although they led to some unwanted side effects with the basic functionalities. In addition to that, lots of new browsers and browser versions were released through the time. The RadEditorcontrol is designed to depend on browser commands for most of the basic editing functionalities.

Since Q2 2013, in order to improve the consistency across different browsers and achieve stronger coherence with the desktop text editing applications,we have introduced major changes in the behavior of some major commands used in the **RadEditor** control. These commands take care of user actions for editing, insertion and modification of inline (span, font etc.) and block (lists, paragraphs, tables, etc.) elements.

As a result of the modification, these commands now exhibit behavior different from what was observed in previous versions of that control.

## What Are the Goals

* Creation of a list over inline nodes separated by line breaks. All inline content should be put in a single block wrapper. This is the default behavior in MS Word;

* The end user should be able to align/indent/outdent a single block element by clicking inside it or marking it;

* Consistent behavior of the Bold, Italic and Strike-trough commands under all major browsers.

* The end user should be able to align/indent/outdent multiple block elements at the same time;

* Creation of a list from an empty line using the corresponding command;

* Creation of a list over multiple block elements;

>note The editing behavior of the inline and block elements is directly related to the set value of the [NewLineMode property]({%slug editor/managing-content/control-new-line-behavior%}), which by default is set to "Br".For example the selection of multiple lines, separated by `<br>` is considered as one whole block element, although if they are separated by `<p>` - all selected lines are considered as different block elements.

## User Experience with RadEditor

The users has already gained experience for text editing from desktop rich text editors (e.g. MS Word). For their convenience most of the known commands are implemented in the **RadEditor** control via different [tools]({%slug editor/functionality/toolbars/overview%}) and their keyboard shortcuts.

If the **NewLineMode** property is used with its default value ("Br") some known actions are somehow different in the **RadEditor**. You can find a list of them in the following table.


| Action | RadEditor | MS Word |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
|Insert Line Break|keyboard shortcut **Shift+Enter** (_Note: If the NewLineMode="Br" property is used - **Enter** key_) |keyboard shortcut **Shift+Enter** |
|Insert Paragraph|keyboard shortcut **Ctrl+Enter** (_Note: If the NewLineMode="P" property is used - **Enter** key_)| **Enter** key|

>note As shown in this table if the **NewLineMode** property is set to "P", the user would be able to use the **RadEditor** with the same experience as in MS Word.

## How to Get the Old Behavior Back

>note For the convenience of the developers who are using the functionality to roll-back the behavior, we want to assure you that the following JavaScript files	will be included in all the future releases of the Telerik® UI for ASP.NET AJAX suite. Also it should be noted that they are deprecated and there will be no further implementation in their logic.

In order to ease the transition between the old and the new behavior of the commands and allow the developers to decide whether to implement or not the introduced breaking change,there is a built-in ability that offers the possibility of bringing back their old behavior.

For the block commands this can be achieved by referencing the **LegacyCommands.js** script file which resides in **Telerik.Web.UI.Editor.RadEditor.Commands** namespace, as illustrated in the example below.

````ASP.NET
<asp:ScriptManager runat="server" ID="ScriptManager1"></asp:ScriptManager>
<script type="text/javascript" src='<%= Page.ClientScript.GetWebResourceUrl(typeof(RadEditor), "Telerik.Web.UI.Editor.RadEditor.Commands.LegacyCommands.js") %>'></script>
````

And for the inline commands - the **LegacyInlineCommands.js** script file which resides in **Telerik.Web.UI.Editor.RadEditor.Commands** namespace, as illustrated in the example below.

````ASP.NET
<asp:ScriptManager runat="server" ID="ScriptManager1"></asp:ScriptManager>
<script type="text/javascript" src="<%= Page.ClientScript.GetWebResourceUrl(typeof(RadEditor), "Telerik.Web.UI.Editor.RadEditor.Commands.LegacyInlineCommands.js") %>"></script>
````

>note Please, note that the JavaScript files has to be included **after** the page's Script Manager in order to override the default commands.
