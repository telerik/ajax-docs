# Serving External Style Sheets



Starting with **Q3 2010 SP1 (version 2010.3.1215) RadStyleSheetManager** has the ability to serve external style sheets **combined or uncombined**. Since this operation requires access to the project file structure, a 'safe' folder or a list of folders must be specified in the **web.config** file of the web application/site.

## Example

You can specify one or more folders from your project that host the external style sheets.

>important The folder paths must be relative to the root of the application, e.g. **'~/path_to_folder'** .
>


### Configuration

Add the following `<appSetting/>` entry in your *web.config*:

````ASPNET
<appsettings>   
    <add key="Telerik.Web.UI.StyleSheetFolders" value="~/App_Themes/; ~/StyleSheets/" />
</appsettings>
````



### Usage

Register the external style sheets in **RadStyleSheetManager**. The paths to the files can be relative to the root or to the folder containing the current page.

````ASPNET
<telerik:RadStyleSheetManager id="RadStyleSheetManager1" runat="server">
    <StyleSheets>
        <telerik:StyleSheetReference Path="~/App_Themes/main.css" />
        <telerik:StyleSheetReference Path="../../StyleSheets/StyleSheet.css" />
    </StyleSheets>
</telerik:RadStyleSheetManager>
````



>caution If an external style sheet, which is not in one of the folder designated in the configuration, an exception will be thrown.
>


## Remarks

* You can specify more than one style sheet folder.

* With internal build **v2011.2.927** links to an external or a combination of external style sheets is timestamped - if the style sheet files are modified, **RadStyleSheetManager** automatically resets the generated link, so that the changes immediately propagate to the client.

* There is one important thing to have in mind when dealing with images in external style sheets. **RadStyleSheetManager** serves external style sheets through the **Telerik.Web.UI.WebResource.axd** handler. The path to the handler is relative to the root of the web site/application, so URLs to images in the served CSS code must also be relative to the root and not to the actual location of the containing style sheets.
