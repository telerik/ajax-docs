# Rating Overview

**Telerik RadRating** is a flexible UI component that allows users to intuitively rate by selecting number of items [stars] from a predefined maximum number of items. The user can fully customize the control by configuring its orientation, rating precision, direction etc.

#### Key features:

* **Horizontal/Vertical Orientation** - depending on your needs, RadRating can be displayed horizontally or vertically on the page by setting the **Orientation** property.

* **Direction** - you can configure the RadRating to reverse its standard direction using its **IsDirectionReversed** property. The standard direction is from left to right (or from top to bottom if it has vertical orientation).

* **Maximum Number of Items** - by setting a value to the **ItemCount** property you can easily choose the maximum number of items the user can rate from.

* **Selection Mode** - it can be Single or Continuous. In Single mode a single item [star] is marked as selected and in Continuous mode all items, starting from the first one, are marked as selected.

* **Rating Precision** - the RadRating control enables the users to select their rating value precisely. By setting the **Precision** property to one of the following: Exact, Half, Item - you can rate by selecting: a precise part of the star [Exact], half a star [Half] or the whole star [Item].
