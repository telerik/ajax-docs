# ScatterLine Chart

The **ScatterLine** chart, as part of the [ASP NET AJAX Chart](https://www.telerik.com/products/aspnet-ajax/html-chart.aspx), is very similar to the [Scatter chart]({%slug htmlchart/chart-types/scatter-chart%})—it shows data as points defined by their items'	values. Its x-axis is also numerical and does not require items. The main difference between ScatterLine charts and Scatter charts is that thesubsequent points are connected with lines and thus it can account for missing values in a series. You'll use ScatterLine charts for showing the relation between different sets of data, for example scientific (experimental) results, or when you need to havetwo numerical axes on a line-type chart. Since Q1 2014 **ScatterLineSeries** can be visualized with	[spline curves]({%slug htmlchart/chart-types/spline-chart%}). This Help article shows which properties to use to customize a ScatterLine chart (**Figure 1**) and shows sample code (**Example 1**) to create one.

>caption Figure 1: A simple ScatterLine chart comparing two sets of data over time. The code in Example 1 shows how to customize	the chart using the MissingValues property to account for a gap in data in the 0.8C ScatterLineSeries.

You can customize the ScatterLine chart:

* The color of each series is controlled via the **BackgroundColor** property of the **ScatterLineSeries -> Appearance -> FillStyle** inner tag.

* The width of the line in each series is controlled via the **Width** property of the **ScatterLineSeries -> LineAppearance** tag.

* The name that is shown in the legend is set via the `Name` property of the series. You can hide the series from the legend either by omitting it, or by setting the `VisibleInLegend` property to `false`.

* The position of each item on the y-axis is controlled by its **Y** property of the **ScatterSeriesItem** and the position of those items according to the x-axis is set with the **X** property.

* Each item can have a label and a tooltip that follows the common pattern defined in the **DataFormatString** property of the **LabelsAppearance** and **TooltipsAppearance** sections of the series.The format string uses the **X** of the item for the **first** placeholder and the **Y** for the **second** placeholder. You can also load custom text from data source fields in labels and tooltips by using the composite [ClientTemplate]({%slug htmlchart/functionality/clienttemplate/overview%}) property.

* The markers are fully customizable—the type, background color, size, border's width and color can be controlled respectively through **MarkersType**, **BackgroundColor**, **Size**, **BorderWidth** and **BorderColor** properties, exposed by the **ScatterLineSeries -> MarkersAppearance** tag.

* The axes are also fully customizable—they automatically adjust the scale to accommodate the data that comes in and for finer tuning there are numerous properties that can change each aspect:

	* Directly in the axis tag you can use its properties to control color, major and minor tick types and sizes, minimal and maximal values for the-Y axis (plus a step size).This is also the place where the crossing value with the other axis can be set and whether the axis will be reversed.

	* The inner tags of the axis tag can control the major and minor grid lines in terms of colour and size and the labels can have a **DataFormatString**, position and visibility set through each inner tag's properties.

* If some values are missing (i.e. they are null/Nothing) from the series data you can have the chart work around this by setting the **MissingValues** property of the series to the desired behavior—interpolate, missing or gap.

* The title, background colors and legend are controlled via the inner properties of the **RadHtmlChart** control and are common for all charts.You can find more information in the [Server-side API]({%slug htmlchart/server-side-programming/basic-configuration%})and in the [Element structure]({%slug htmlchart/radhtmlchart-structure%}) articles.

The ScatterLine chart from **Figure 1** is created with the code in **Example 1**:

>tip Not all properties are necessary. The **RadHtmlChart** will match the axes to the values if you do not declare explicit values, steps and tick properties.

>caption Example 1: Creating a ScatterLine chart that compares two sets of static data over a time period with customized properties. The property for **MissingValues** is set to **Gap** for the 0.8C **ScatterLineSeries**.
