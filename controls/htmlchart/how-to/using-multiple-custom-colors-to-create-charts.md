# Using Multiple Custom Colors to Create Charts

This help article addresses the challenge that the [ASP NET AJAX Chart](https://www.telerik.com/products/aspnet-ajax/html-chart.aspx) offers a limited number of ten predefined colors for its skins and suggests a solution for increasing them.

If you create more series (or more items for a **PieSeries**) these colors will start repeating themselves. Developers at Telerik decided that they cannot increase the internal number of colors indefinitely because the number may always be insufficient for a certain scenario.

There is a rather easy way around this, however. You can create a static class to hold a declaration of colors that will fit the current needs in terms of number, the exact colors that are chosen or any other logic that may apply.This static collection can be iterated over to return the desired color according to their indexes - the index of the series can point to the index of its color.

All series types expose the **ColorField** property since **Q1 2013**. It can be used to specify a column in the data source from which the color for each item in the series will be taken. **PieSeries** expose this property a little bit earlier in **Q3 2012**.

**Example 1** shows a simple example of creating a static class to increase the number of colors for a chart while **Example 2** shows how a Bar chart could use the static class.

>caption Example 1: Creating a StaticColors class with ten hard-coded colors.

````C#
using System.Drawing;

/// <summary>
/// A Class that provides functionality for using a custom list of predefined list of colors
/// </summary>
public static class StaticColors
{
	/// <summary>
	/// Gets the color corrsponding to the passed index.

	/// <param name="index">The index in the array of predefined colors</param>
	/// <returns>The color corresponding to the passed index. Useful for programmatic creation of charts, for example.</returns>
	public static Color GetColor(int index)
	{
		return colors[index % colors.Length];
	}

	/// <summary>
	/// The list of hardcoded colors.
	/// </summary>
	/// <remarks>
	/// Can be extended manually by the developer or the class can be modified so that the property can be modified during runtime.

	private static readonly Color[] colors = 
	{
		Color.Red,
		Color.Blue,
		Color.Green,
		Color.Yellow,
		Color.Purple,
		Color.Orange,
		Color.Violet,
		Color.NavajoWhite,
		Color.MediumSeaGreen,

	};
}

You can use a static class like this in different ways. For example **Example 2** shows a loop(which is hard-coded for demonstration purposes, but can actually use the number of columns and rows in the data source) with a Bar chart using the static color class.

>caption Example 2: A Bar chart using the StaticColors class created in **Example 1**.

````C#
protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
	if (!IsPostBack)
	{
		for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
		{
			BarSeries bs = new BarSeries();
			bs.Appearance.FillStyle.BackgroundColor = StaticColors.GetColor(i);
			RadHtmlChart1.PlotArea.Series.Add(bs);
			for (int j = 1; j < 4; j++)
			{
				CategorySeriesItem si = new CategorySeriesItem();
				si.Y = j;
				bs.SeriesItems.Add(si);
			}
		}
	}
}
````
````VB
Protected Sub Page_Load(sender As Object, e As EventArgs)
	If Not IsPostBack Then
		Dim i As Integer = 0
		While i < 10
			Dim bs As New BarSeries()
			bs.Appearance.FillStyle.BackgroundColor = StaticColors.GetColor(i)
			RadHtmlChart1.PlotArea.Series.Add(bs)
			Dim j As Integer = 1
			While j < 4
				Dim si As New CategorySeriesItem()
				si.Y = j
				bs.SeriesItems.Add(si)
				j += 1
			End While
			i += 1
		End While
	End If
End Sub
