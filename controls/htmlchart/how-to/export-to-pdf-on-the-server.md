# Embed RadHtmlChart in PDF on the Server Side

The most straightforward way to export the [ASP NET AJAX Chart](https://www.telerik.com/products/aspnet-ajax/html-chart.aspx) is [to do it client-side](https://demos.telerik.com/aspnet-ajax/client-export-manager/applicationscenarios/export-radhtmlchart/defaultcs.aspx) as the control renders entirely in the browser. Exporting **RadHtmlChart** to PDF on the server side, though, requires that first the SVG rendering of the chart is transferred to the server. In this article, you will find different options to export **RadHtmlChart** to PDF on the server so you can choose the one that fits your scenario the best:

* [Export RadHtmlChart via RadPDFProcessing](#export-radhtmlchart-via-radpdfprocessing)

* [Export RadHtmlChart via Telerik Reporting](#export-radhtmlchart-via-telerik-reporting)

* [Export RadHtmlChart via Third-party Library](#export-radhtmlchart-via-third-party-library)

* [Generate and Export RadHtmlChart Entirely Sever Side](#export-radhtmlchart-entirely-server-side)



## Export RadHtmlChart via RadPDFProcessing

By utilizing the **RadPdfProcessing** API you can easily create a document containing the **RadHtmlChart** control by rendering it as an image, generated by the canvas object of the control. You can watch a live demo demonstrating this approach:

## Export RadHtmlChart via Telerik Reporting

You can also export the **RadHtmlChart** loaded on the page to a Telerik report, which is processed and rendered on the server. In order to achieve this you will need to save the loaded on the page chart as an `image` or `byte[]` on the server, which allows you to load it in a [PictureBox item](https://docs.telerik.com/reporting/report-items-picture-box) afterwards. A similar approach incorporating the Kendo UI Chart widget is demonstrated in this code library:

Another possible way to embed **RadHtmlChart** in a **Telerik Reporting** document is to load the passed to the server chart image through a user function:
[Telerik Reporting User Functions](https://docs.telerik.com/reporting/expressions-user-functions).


## Export RadHtmlChart via Third-party Library

You can also export **RadHtmlChart** by using a third party library (like [InkScape](https://inkscape.org/en/)) that can convert the chart’s SVG image to a more common user format such as PNG or PDF. A code library showing how to achieve this is available here:
[Export RadHtmlChart to PDF server-side via third-party library](https://www.telerik.com/support/code-library/exporting-radhtmlchart-to-png-and-pdf).



## Generate and Export RadHtmlChart Entirely Sever Side

As stated in the beginning of the article, **RadHtmlChart** is rendered on the client side, so you will need to render it in a browser in order to capture the control’s SVG data and pass it to the server. Whether you open this browser on the client machine and send the image/svg `base64` string to the server or you open the browser on the server (and use other scripts and tools to save the image), is the same.
There are several tools (like [Phantom.js](http://phantomjs.org/)) that can be used in order to load the chart in a virtual browser and export it to PDF directly, avoiding the visible browser rendering of the control.
