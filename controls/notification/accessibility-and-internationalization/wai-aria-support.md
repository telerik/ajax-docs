# WAI-ARIA Support

@[template](/_templates/common/wai-aria-templates.md#intro "control: RadNotification")


The [WAI-ARIA Suite](http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/aria) defines an approach to make web content and web applications more accessible to people with disabilities. **RadNotification** offers WAI-ARIA support.

In order to enable the WAI-ARIA support, set the **RadNotification**'s **EnableAriaSupport** property to **true** as shown in the example below.

**Example 1**: Setting the **EnableAriaSupport** property for **RadNotification**



````ASP.NET
<telerik:RadNotification RenderMode="Lightweight" EnableAriaSupport="true" runat="server" ID="RadNotification1"></telerik:RadNotification>
````
````C#
RadNotification1.EnableAriaSupport = true;
````
````VB
RadNotification1.EnableAriaSupport = True
````



>note The implementation of the WAI ARIA support is achieved entirely client-side (using JavaScript) by appending different attributes and appropriate WAI-ARIA roles to the DOM elements.	This is done because an HTML document containing ARIA attributes will not pass validation if they are added on the server.



>tip According to the WAI-ARIA specifications, the first input in a dialog should get the focus when the dialog opens.	In case the **ContentTemplate** of the control is used and it contains inputs, their focus should be handled by the developer. The [OnClientShown event](../client-side-programming/events/onclientshown) and the [control's Client-side API](../client-side-programming/radnotification-object) can be used for this.
