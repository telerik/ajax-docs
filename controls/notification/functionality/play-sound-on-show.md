# Play Sound on Show




Since **Q3 2011** the **RadNotification** offers the ability to play a sound when it is shown so that the user can notice it even if the page is not active. This is turned on by setting a value to the **ShowSound** property. You can pass an URL to your custom sound, which must be in **wav** format.

Just like with the [icons]({%slug notification/functionality/embedded-icons%}), there is also a set of predefined sounds built-in the **RadNotification** that you can use directly:

* info
* warning
* ok

>warning Audio in mobile devices can only be played after a user action. This is a limitation of mobile browsers that also affects the **RadNotification** control. You can find more information and a possible solution in the [Notification Audio Is Not Played In Mobile Devices](../troubleshooting/notification-audio-is-not-played-in-mobile-devices) help article.
