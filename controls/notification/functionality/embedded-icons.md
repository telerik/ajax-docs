# Embedded Icons



## 

**RadNotification** provides two icons in its UI to help convey the message - the **TitleIcon** and **ContentIcon**. The **TitleIcon**'s size is 16 by 16 pixels and the **ContentIcon**'s size is 32 by 32 pixels. You can point these properties to a custom image in your application or you can use the embedded icons. The list with the possible values for the embedded icons is as follows:

* info

* delete

* deny

* edit

* ok

* warning

* none

>note The built-in icons work only when the embedded skins are used. If you externalize the skins or use a custom skin you cannot set them via the above shorthand values. If you wish to use them in this case please examine[this KB article](http://www.telerik.com/support/kb/aspnet-ajax/notification/using-the-built-in-icons-with-a-custom-skin.aspx)on the matter.
