# Skins



## 

To make customizing the appearance of **RadNotification** as easy as possible, the control uses skins. A skin is a set of images and a CSS stylesheet that are applied to the HTML elements which make up the notification, defining the look and feel.

To apply a skin, set the **Skin** property of the **RadNotification**. You can set the it by using the properties pane, the server-side property or the control's Smart Tag.

**RadNotification** is installed with a number of predefined skins:

>note The **Hay** , **Forest** , **Sitefinity** and **Transparent** skins are obsolete and have been removed from the Telerik.Web.UI.Skins.dll assembly as of **Q1 2014** .	You can find more information on the matter in[this blog post](http://blogs.telerik.com/aspnet-ajax/posts/13-04-11/6-telerik-asp.net-ajax-skins-going-obsolete).

>note The **Shadow** and **Rounded Corners** are achieved via CSS3 properties and will not have effect under browsers that do not support them (such as IE8 and prior, FireFox 3, etc).
