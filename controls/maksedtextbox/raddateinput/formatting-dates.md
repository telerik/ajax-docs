# Formatting Dates



## 

The table below shows a list of the standard format characters. For each standard pattern, it shows the pattern from the current **Culture** settings that the pattern represents. The format characters are case-sensitive; for example, 'f' and 'F' represent different patterns.


>caption  

| Format Character | Descriptionr |
| ------ | ------ |
|d|Short date pattern|
|D|Long date pattern|
|f|Full date and time (long date and short time)|
|F|Full date time pattern (long date and long time)|
|g|General (short date and short time)|
|G|General (short date and long time)|
|m, M|Month day pattern|
|r, R|RFC1123 pattern|
|s|Sortable date time pattern (based on ISO 8601) using local time|
|t|Short time pattern|
|T|Long time pattern|
|y|Month year pattern|

>caution When you set the **DateFormat** or **DisplayDateFormat** property to one of these format characters, the **RadDateInput** control automatically expands it into aformat string built of the patterns listed below. Thus, changing the **Culture** property after setting the **DateFormat** or **DisplayDateFormat** property to one of these format characters will not change the overall pattern, but only the interpretation of symbols within the pattern.

The table below shows a list of patterns that can be combined to create custom patterns. The patterns are case-sensitive; for example, "MM" is recognized, but "mm" is not. If the custom pattern contains white-space characters or characters enclosed in single quotation marks, the output string will also contain those characters. Characters not defined as part of a format pattern or as format characters are reproduced literally.
