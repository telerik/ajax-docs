# RadDatePicker Overview


The **RadDatePicker** control is composed of **RadDateInput** control with an integrated **RadCalendar**. The users can enter the date value directly into the input area or select it from a calendar popup. The values of the two controls are synchronized to enable further change of the chosen date.



## Features

**RadDatePicker** for ASP.NET AJAX is a highly configurable date input control that offers the following features:

* A [client-side API]({%slug datepicker/client-side-programming/overview%}) with powerful methods that let you configure the picker and [events]({%slug datepicker/client-side-programming/events/overview%}) that let you intercept what the user is doing.














* A [customizable day matrix]({%slug calendar/radcalendar/customizing-the-day-matrix%}) to give you control over the calendar layout.

* Configurable [navigation controls]({%slug calendar/radcalendar/navigation-controls-settings%}).

* Support for localization, including [culture-dependant date formatting]({%slug calendar/accessibility-and-internationalization/specifying-a-culture%}) and the ability to [localize all strings]({%slug calendar/accessibility-and-internationalization/localizing-strings%}) in the user interface.

* [Keyboard support]({%slug calendar/accessibility-and-internationalization/keyboard-support%}) for selecting and navigating the calendar.

* Ability to customize the look-and-feel either by using [skins]({%slug calendar/appearance-and-styling/skins%}), or by setting [styles]({%slug calendar/appearance-and-styling/styles%}) to affect various parts of the calendar.
