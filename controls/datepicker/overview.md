# RadDatePicker Overview


The **RadDatePicker** control is composed of **RadDateInput** control with an integrated **RadCalendar**. The users can enter the date value directly into the input area or select it from a calendar popup. The values of the two controls are synchronized to enable further change of the chosen date.



## Features

**RadDatePicker** for ASP.NET AJAX is a highly configurable date input control that offers the following features:

* A [client-side API]({%slug datepicker/client-side-programming/raddatepicker-object%}) with powerful methods that let you configure the picker and [events]({%slug datepicker/client-side-programming/events/overview%}) that let you intercept what the user is doing.

* Complete access to the embedded controls that make up the picker control with the ability to [configure these controls]({%slug datepicker/functionality/customizing-embedded-controls%}) separately.

* Support for [ASP.NET validation controls]({%slug datepicker/functionality/validation%}).

* [Keyboard support]({%slug datepicker/accessibility-and-internationalization/keyboard-support%}) for selecting and navigating the control.
