# Server-side events Overview



The **RadDatePicker** controls expose the following server-side events:

* [ChildrenCreated]({%slug datepicker/server-side-programming/events/childrencreated%}) occurs when the child controls (the input area, popup buttons, and embedded calendar) are created.

* [SelectedDateChanged]({%slug datepicker/server-side-programming/events/selecteddatechanged%}) occurs when the user changes the value of the control, either when input area loses focus after the user has typed a new value, or when the user selects a new value in the popup calendar or time view control.


>tip In order for the server-side events to be fired the **RadDatePicker** should trigger postback. You need to set the **AutoPostBack** property to **true**.
