# Events Overview



The **RadDatePicker** control supports a number of client-side events that let you respond to user actions without a postback. The following table lists the various client events, and which controls they apply to:


| Event | Applies to | Description |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
|[OnDateSelected]({%slug datepicker/client-side-programming/events/ondateselected%})| **RadDatePicker** |Occurs immediately after the value of the control's selection has been changed.|
|[OnPopupOpening]({%slug datepicker/client-side-programming/events/onpopupopening%})| **RadDatePicker** |Occurs immediately before a popup is displayed, before the selection in the popup is synchronized with the input area.|
|[OnPopupClosing]({%slug datepicker/client-side-programming/events/onpopupclosing%})| **RadDatePicker** |Occurs immediately before the a popup is closed.|


>tip The embedded **RadDateInput** object that is used by **RadDatePicker** also has number of client-side events. See the **RadInput** documentation for details.

To use these events, simply write a JavaScript function that can be called when the event occurs. Then assign the name of the JavaScript function as the value of the the corresponding property.
