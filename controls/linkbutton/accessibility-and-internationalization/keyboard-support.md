# Keyboard Support

There are several ways to use the **RadLinkButton** via the keyboard only:

* Set its **TabIndex** property and use the **Tab** key to navigate to the desired button and then press the **Enter** key to invoke a click on the button.

* Set its **AccessKey** property. This allows you to use the browser's shortcut combination to invoke the click ("Alt + AccessKey in IE and Chrome", "Shift + Alt + AccessKey" for Firefox, Shift + Esc + AccessKey for Opera).

>tip Note: By default tab-access is disabled in Safari. To enable it, check "Preferences > Advanced > Press tab to highlight each item on a page".
