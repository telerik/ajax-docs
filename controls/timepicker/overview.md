# RadTimePicker Overview


The Telerik **RadTimePicker** control is composed of a **RadDateInput** control in time only mode and **RadTimeView** control. Users can enter time directly in the input area or select it from the **TimeView** popup. The values of the two controls are synchronized to allow further change of the selected time.


## Features


* [Client-side API]({%slug timepicker/client-side-programming/overview%}) for controlling the date and time pickers without unnecessary postbacks and [client-side events]({%slug calendar/client-side-programming/events/overview%}) on the picker controls and their embedded input controls and popups.

* Complete access to the embedded controls that make up the picker control with the ability to [configure these controls]({%slug timepicker/functionality/customizing-the-embedded-controls%}) separately.

* [Sharable popup controls]({%slug timepicker/functionality/using-shared-radtimeview%}) for smaller rendering and better performance.

* Support for [data-binding]({%slug timepicker/functionality/data-binding%}).

* Support for localization, including [culture-dependant date formatting]({%slug timepicker/accessibility-and-internationalization/specifying-a-culture%}) and the ability to [localize all strings]({%slug calendar/accessibility-and-internationalization/localizing-strings%}) in the user interface.

* [Configurable time view]({%slug timepicker/functionality/configuring-the-embedded-time-view%}) control for selecting time values.

* Support for [ASP.NET validation controls]({%slug timepicker/functionality/validation%}).

* [Keyboard support]({%slug timepicker/accessibility-and-internationalization/keyboard-support%}).

* [Template support]({%slug timepicker/templates/radtimeview-templates%}) for the time view popup.

* Ability to customize the look-and-feel either by using [skins]({%slug timepicker/appearance-and-styling/skins%}), or by setting [styles]({%slug timepicker/appearance-and-styling/styles%}) to affect the various parts of the control and its appearance, depending on its state.

* WAI-ARIA Support.
