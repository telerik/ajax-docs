# NodeDrop



## 

The **NodeDrop** is raised when a Node is dragged and dropped on non-child Node.

The event handler receives two parameters:

1. The instance of the orgchart firing the event

2. An event arguments parameter containing the following properties:

* **DestinationNode** - the Node on which the dragged Node is dropped.

* **SourceNode** - the dropped Node.
