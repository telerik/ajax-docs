# Google Analytics Integration




The **RadSocialShare** control offers full Google Analytics support which can be enabled by setting a single property - **GoogleAnalyticsUA** to web property ID (also known as UA number).

Key features:

* Asynchronous implementation

* Multi trackers support

* Having more than one **RadSocialShare** instances with the same UA will all be logged in the same tracker instead of overidding each other
