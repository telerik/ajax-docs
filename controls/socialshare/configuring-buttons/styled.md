# Styled



**RadSocialShare** offers a set of built-in buttons that have consitent icon dimensions of 16px by 16px and their icons are simple and in the same style.They are called **Styled Buttons** as they utilize the public API that the different social networks provide and their appearance can be controlled by the developer. They are used via the **`<telerik:RadSocialButton />`** tag and one of its properties controls which social network is used by the rendered button - the **SocialNetType** property.

The **SocialNetType** property is the only property that is *required*. Its value is an enumerator with the following options for the different social networks:

* **ShareOnTwitter** - for [www.Twitter.com](http://www.Twitter.com/)

* **LinkedIn** - for [www.LinkedIn.com](http://www.LinkedIn.com/)

* **Delicious** - for [www.Delicious.com](http://www.Delicious.com/)

* **Blogger** - for [www.Blogger.com](http://www.Blogger.com/)

* **Digg** - for [www.Digg.com](http://www.Digg.com/)

* **Reddit** - for [www.Reddit.com](http://www.Reddit.com/)

* **StumbleUpon** - for [www.StumbleUpon.com](http://www.StumbleUpon.com/)

* **MySpace** - for [www.MySpace.com](http://www.MySpace.com/)

* **Tumblr** - for [www.Tumblr.com](http://www.Tumblr.com/)

* **ShareOnFacebook** - for [www.facebook.com](http://www.facebook.com/)

* **ShareOnGooglePlus** - for [plus.google.com](https://plus.google.com/)

* **GoogleBookmarks** - for [www.google.com/bookmarks](http://www.google.com/bookmarks)

* **ShareOnYammer** - for [www.yammer.com](http://www.yammer.com/)

* **ShareOnPinterest** - for [www.pinterest.com](http://www.pinterest.com/)

There are also three other options that invoke the [e-mail functionality]({%slug socialshare/functionality/sending-via-e-mail%}) and open the [compact buttons]({%slug socialshare/configuring-buttons/collections%}):

* **MailTo** - opens the user machine's mail client

* **SendEmail** - opens the built-in Send E-mail form in the browser

* **CompactButton** - it is used to trigger the popup with the [Compact Buttons collection]({%slug socialshare/configuring-buttons/collections%}).Unlike the **`<telerik:RadCompactButton />`** this opens the popup with the settings declared for the browser popup (see below).

>note If any of the other options is chosen for the **SocialNetType** this invokes the [Standard Button]({%slug socialshare/configuring-buttons/standard%}) instead which is rendered by external scripts and the other properties do not apply.



The rest of the properties are listed below with their descriptions:

* **UrlToShare** - the URL sent to the social network or e-mail. If the property is set here it overrides the one set in the main tag

* **ToolTip** - sets the button's tooltip. If a label is set this also applies to the label. The default tooltips depends on the social network

* **LabelText** - sets the text that appears next to the button as a label. It is also clickable and acts as a button

* **CustomIconUrl** - sets an URL for a custom icon for the button

* **CustomIconWidth** - sets the width of the icon in pixels

* **CustomIconHeight** - sets the height of the icon in pixels

* **DialogWidth** - defines the width of the popup in pixels

* **DialogHeight** - defines the height of the popup in pixels

* **DialogTop** - defines the popup's vertical offset from the top edge of the screen in pixels

* **DialogLeft** - defines the popup's horizontal offset from the left edge of the screen in pixels
