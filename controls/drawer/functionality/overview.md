# Functionality

The drawer widget has two modes of interaction - `overlay(default)` and push and two positions - `left`_(default)_ and `right` which determine the side from which the drawer will appear. 

It has `gesture support` and also features `mini mode` which makes the drawer always partly visible and allows the user to reveal its full content either with a gesture or by calling the `show()` method of the widget.

To learn more about the functionalities and how to use them, you can follow the links below:
