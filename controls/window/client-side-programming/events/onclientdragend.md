# OnClientDragEnd



## 

The **OnClientDragEnd** event of the **RadWindow** fires when the user stops dragging the popup.

The event handler receives the following arguments:

1. The [RadWindow]({%slug window/client-side-programming/radwindow-object%}) object that fired the event.

1. An event arguments object that does not expose any methods and properties.

You can use this event to get the final position of the dialog by calling the `getWindowBounds()` method	from the [RadWindow client-side API]({%slug window/client-side-programming/radwindow-object%}).
