# OnClientResizeEnd



## 

The __OnClientResizeEnd__ event of the __RadWindow__ fires when the user finished resizing the popup.

The event handler receives the following arguments:

1. The [RadWindow]({%slug window/client-side-programming/radwindow-object%}) object that fired the event.

1. An event arguments object that does not expose any methods and properties.

You can use this event to get the final dimensions of the dialog by calling the `getWindowBounds()` methodfrom the [RadWindow client-side API]({%slug window/client-side-programming/radwindow-object%}).
