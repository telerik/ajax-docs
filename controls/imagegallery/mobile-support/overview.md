# Mobile Support Overview



__Telerik ASP.NET Image Gallery__ comes with built-in __responsive__ behavior. When accessed via a mobile device,the control changes its appearance to better fit the device screen size. A sample demonstration of the mobile capabilities of the control can be observed [here](http://demos.telerik.com/aspnet-ajax/image-gallery/examples/mobile-and-touch-support/responsive-behavior/defaultcs.aspx). For optimal experience on mobile devices, we suggest that you use __Telerik__ controls together with the [Page Layout Framework](http://www.telerik.com/products/aspnet-ajax/responsive-page-layout.aspx), which will add responsive capabilities to your layout.
