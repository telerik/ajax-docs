# Getting Started with the Telerik WebForms TreeList



This tutorial will walk you through creating a Web page that contains a RadTreeList control. It shows how to create and bind a RadTreeList control using a declarative data source.

## Creating and Binding the RadTreeList

1. Locate the "..\Live Demos\App_Data" folder underneath the folder where you have installed UI for ASP.NET AJAX controls. In this folder, find the "Northwind.mdf" file and copy it into the App_Data folder of your Web application. The Solution Explorer for your application may look something like the following:
![App_Data](images/treelist_gettingstarted1.png "App_Data")

2. Using the RadTreeList Smart tag expand the drop-down list labelled **Choose Data Source** and select ```<New data source...>``:
![Smart tag](images/treelist_designtime1.png "Smart tag]")

3. The **Data Source Configuration Wizard** appears. On the **Choose a Data Source Type** page, select "SQL Database" and click OK:

4. On the **Choose Your Data Connection** page click the New Connection button and select the "Northwind.mdb" file that you copied into App_Data folder. Then click the Next button:
![Choose Your Data Connection](images/treelist_gettingstarted4.png "Choose Your Data Connection")

5. On the **Configure Select Statement** page, select the "Employees" table from the drop-down list, and select the "EmployeeID", "LastName", "FirstName", "Region", "PostalCode" and "Country" fields. Then choose Next:
![Configure Select Statement](images/treelist_gettingstarted5.png "Configure Select Statement")

6. On the **Test Query** page, click the Test Query button to see the data. Then click Finish, to exit the Configure Data Source wizard:
![Test Query](images/treelist_gettingstarted6.png "Test Query")

For more information about how to configure the RadTreeList through the Visual Studio designer, see the [Design Time]({%slug treelist/design-time%}) article.
