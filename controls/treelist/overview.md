# WebForms TreeList Overview


Telerik RadTreeList is a hybrid control combining treeview and grid in one. It gives you the opportunity for hierarchical representation of the underlying data like in a treeview. In addition it can have multiple columns and provides you with the ability to perform advanced operations like paging, sorting, selecting items, etc.

#### Key Features

The key features of the RadTreelist control are:

* **Various column types**

* **Data editing operations, auto-generated and custom edit forms support, as well as different edit modes**

* **Integrated paging**

* **Easily customizable skinning mechanism (setting single Skin property of the treelist)**

* **The ShowOuterBorders, ShowTreeLines and GridLines properties allow you to quickly change the appearance**

* **Interoperability with RadAjax and loading indicators** - dramatically improves the responsiveness of the component, simulates Windows-application like behavior, and minimizes the traffic to the server

* **Single and Multi-Row Server-Side and Client-Side Selection**
