# Input Mask Dialog



The **Input Mask dialog** lets you create and modify the masks that are the values of the **RadMaskedTextBox** control's **Mask** and **DisplayMask** properties. You can display the Input Mask dialog in two ways:

* From the **RadMaskedTextBox**Â [Smart Tag]({%slug radmaskedtextbox/design-time/smart-tag%}), choose the **SetMask** link. When you bring up the Input Mask dialog in this way, the mask you create or choose is assigned to the **Mask** property, which controls the mask that is used when the user can edit the value.

* Click the ellipsis button next to the **Mask** or **DisplayMask** property in the properties pane. The **DisplayMask** property is an optional override to the **Mask** property, for formatting the value of the masked text box when it does not have focus.

At the top of the dialog is a table of pre-defined masks that you can choose for common input tasks, along with sample values.

* To choose a pre-defined mask, select its row in the table. The mask automatically appears in the **Mask** text box, with a preview to show the prompts and literals below it.

* To specify a mask that is not pre-defined, choose **<Custom>** from the table of pre-defined masks. When you choose custom, the last mask that was selected in the table remains in the **Mask** text box for you to use as a starting point in entering a new mask. The preview updates as you edit the mask.

>tip For complicated masks, you may choose to use the **[MaskPart Collection Editor]({%slug radmaskedtextbox/design-time/maskpart-collection-editor%})** instead.
