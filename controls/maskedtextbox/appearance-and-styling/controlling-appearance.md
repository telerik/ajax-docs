# Controlling Appearance



A number of properties let you set the look and feel of the **RadInput** controls:

* The **Skin** property lets you specify a [skin]({%slug radmaskedtextbox/appearance-and-styling/skins%}) to set the overall look and feel of the input control.

* In addition to the skin, you can [set a variety of styles]({%slug radmaskedtextbox/appearance-and-styling/styles%}) that let the input control change its appearance depending on whether it is enabled or disabled, is under the mouse, has focus, contains an empty value, or contains an invalid value.

* The **Label** property lets you add a label to the input control.

* The **EmptyMessage** property lets you specify a string that appears when the user has not entered a value.

* The **ButtonsPosition** property lets you specify the layout of any buttons associated with the input control.

* The **WrapperCssClass** property specifies the CSS class(es) added to the wrapper element of the RadInput control.

* The **LabelCssClass** property specifies the CSS class(es) added to the label of the RadInput control.

* The **LabelWidth** property specifies the width of the label of the RadInput control.

* The **Width** property specifies the width of the wrapper of the control.

In addition to the properties mentioned above, which apply to all types of **RadInput** controls, each type of control has additional properties that affect its appearance.


## RadMaskedTextBox

**RadMaskedTextBox** also supports the **TextMode** property, so that you can create both single-line and multi-line text boxes.

**RadMaskedTextBox** also uses the **Mask**, **Prompt**, **DisplayMask**, and **DisplayPrompt** properties to customize the formatting of the value, based on the Mask that also restricts the allowable input. For details, see [Using RadmaskedTextBox]({%slug radmaskedtextbox/overview%}).
