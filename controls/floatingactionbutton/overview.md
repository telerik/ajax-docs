# FloatingActionButton Overview

The Telerik RadFloatingActionButton is a component tied to the primary action of a screen. It floats in the application above other items and has some main action that is contextual to the content on the page.

RadFloatingActionButton is available as of R3 2022 and it is a server-side WebForms wrapper over the [Kendo UI FloatingActionButton for jQuery](https://docs.telerik.com/kendo-ui/controls/navigation/floatingactionbutton/overview) widget.
