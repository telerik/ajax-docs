# ChildrenCreated


**RadMonthYearPicker** exposes the **ChildrenCreated** server event that occurs after the child controls are created.

>caution  
**ChildrenCreated** can be wired only during the **Page_PreInit** event, since it is fired before the regular handlers are attached.
>


The **ChildrenCreated** event handler receives two arguments:

1. The control whose children have just been created. This argument is of type object, but can be cast to the appropriate type.

2. A **DefaultViewChangedEventArgs** object. This object has the following two properties:

	* **OldView** is the **CalendarView** object for the view that was current before the change.

	* **NewView** is the **CalendarView** object for the current view after the change.

You can use this event to set date input, calendar and time view properties, or add additional controls. The following example uses the **ChildrenCreated** event handler to add a control that clears the selection:



````C#
protected void RadMonthYearPicker1_ChildrenCreated(object sender, System.EventArgs e)
{
    RadMonthYearPicker picker = (RadMonthYearPicker)sender;
    HyperLink clearLink = new HyperLink();
    clearLink.NavigateUrl = string.Format("javascript:$find('{0}').Clear()", picker.ClientID);
    clearLink.Text = "Clear";
    picker.Controls.Add(clearLink);
}
````
````VB.NET
Protected Sub RadMonthYearPicker1_ChildrenCreated(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles RadMonthYearPicker1.ChildrenCreated
    Dim picker As RadMonthYearPicker = DirectCast(sender, RadMonthYearPicker)
    Dim clearLink As New HyperLink()
    clearLink.NavigateUrl = _
      String.Format("javascript:$find('{0}').Clear()", picker.ClientID)
    clearLink.Text = "Clear"
    picker.Controls.Add(clearLink)
End Sub
````
