# Client-Side Programming Overview



## Client-side Object Model

Telerik **RadGrid** provides the following objects on the client-side:


|  **Classes/properties**  |  **Description**  |
| ------ | ------ |
| ** *RadGrid* ** |This is the main class. You can use it to access the whole grid object.|
| **[.get_masterTableView()]({%slug grid/client-side-programming/radgrid-object/properties/get_mastertableview()%})** |This is an object of type **GridTableView** . Use this object to access the root table in hierarchical structures.|
| **[.get_masterTableViewHeader()]({%slug grid/client-side-programming/radgrid-object/properties/get_mastertableviewheader()%})** |Returns the master table header instance for the respective grid client object.|
| **[.get_masterTableViewFooter()]({%slug grid/client-side-programming/radgrid-object/properties/get_mastertableviewfooter()%})** |Returns the master table footer instance for the respective grid client object.|
| **[.get_detailTables()]({%slug grid/client-side-programming/radgrid-object/properties/get_detailtables()%})** |This collection represents the detail tables when you have a hierarchical structured grid. Every table is of type **GridTableView** .|
| **[.get_editItems()]({%slug grid/client-side-programming/radgrid-object/properties/get_edititems()%})** |This property retrieves all **GridDataItem** objects that are in edit mode across all grid tables.|
| **[.get_allowMultiRowSelection()]({%slug grid/client-side-programming/radgrid-object/properties/get_allowmultirowselection()%})** |This property is of type Boolean. When set to **true** , you can select multiple rows on the client.|
| **[.set_activeRow()]({%slug grid/client-side-programming/radgrid-object/properties/set_activerow()%})** |Property which marks the row passed as an argument as active and highlighted.|
| **[.get_element()]({%slug grid/client-side-programming/radgrid-object/properties/get_element()%})** |Property that returns the DOM element of the grid div.|
| **[.get_id()]({%slug grid/client-side-programming/radgrid-object/properties/get_id()%})** |Property that returns the id of the grid client object.|
| **[.get_selectedItems()]({%slug grid/client-side-programming/radgrid-object/properties/get_selecteditems()%})** |Property that returns an array of the grid rows selected on the client (and all sub-levels in the hierarchical grid structure).|
| **[.get_headerMenu()]({%slug grid/client-side-programming/radgrid-object/properties/get_headermenu()%})** |Property that returns the client object of the [grid header context menu](http://demos.telerik.com/aspnet-ajax/grid/examples/generalfeatures/headercontextmenu/defaultcs.aspx). Useful when you would like to customize the items in it on the client (see the JavaScript logic at the top of [this help topic](http://www.telerik.com/help/aspnet-ajax/grdreducingfiltermenuoptions.html) for reference).|
| **[.get_allowActiveRow()]({%slug grid/client-side-programming/radgrid-object/properties/get_allowactiverowcycle()%})** |Property that returns the value for the respective server property of the control (ClientSettings -> KeyboardNavigationSettings -> AllowActiveRowCycle).|
| **[.get_visible()]({%slug grid/client-side-programming/radgrid-object/properties/get_visible()%})** |Property that determines whether the grid is visible on the client or not (style="display:none").|
| **[.set_visible()]({%slug grid/client-side-programming/radgrid-object/properties/set_visible()%})** |Property that sets the grid as visible or not on the client (changing the *style-> display* value of the grid div).|
| ** *GridTableView* ** |Class that wraps the client-side features of the **GridTableView** object. Each GridTableView client instance has **GridColumn** and **GridDataItem** objects for manipulating the grid's items and columns client-side.|
| **[.get_allowMultiColumnSorting()]({%slug grid/client-side-programming/gridtableview-object/properties/get_allowmulticolumnsorting()%})** |Returns a **Boolean** value indicating whether multi-column sorting is enabled for the grid instance.|
| **[.set_allowMultiColumnSorting()]({%slug grid/client-side-programming/gridtableview-object/properties/set_allowmulticolumnsorting()%})** |Sets whether multi-column sorting is enabled for the grid instance.|
| **[.get_owner()]({%slug grid/client-side-programming/gridtableview-object/properties/get_owner()%})** |This property is of type **RadGrid** and presents the parent of the current object.|
| **[.get_element()]({%slug grid/client-side-programming/gridtableview-object/properties/get_element()%})** |Returns the HTML table that represents the respective table for the **GridTableView** object rendered on the client.|
| **[.get_dataItems()]({%slug grid/client-side-programming/gridtableview-object/properties/get_dataitems()%})** |A collection that holds all data items (objects of type **GridDataItem** ) in the respective table.|
| **[.get_selectedItems()]({%slug grid/client-side-programming/gridtableview-object/properties/get_selecteditems()%})** |A collection which holds all selected items (objects of type **GridDataItem** ) in the respective table. This collection will include the selected items from the table's child tables (meaningful in a hierarchical grid only).|
| **[.get_editItems()]({%slug grid/client-side-programming/gridtableview-object/properties/get_edititems()%})** |This property retrieves the **GridDataItem** objects of the current table view that are in edit mode.|
| **[.get_insertItem()]({%slug grid/client-side-programming/gridtableview-object/properties/get_insertitem()%})** |This property retrieves the HTML element of the currently inserted item.|
| **[.get_columns()]({%slug grid/client-side-programming/gridtableview-object/properties/get_columns()%})** |A collection that holds objects of type **GridColumn** (the client-side objects) in the respective table.|
| **[.get_name()]({%slug grid/client-side-programming/gridtableview-object/properties/get_name()%})** |String that represents the **Name** property (set on the server) for the corresponding GridTableView client object. It can be used to identify a table in a grid hierarchy on the client-side.|
| **[.get_isItemInserted()]({%slug grid/client-side-programming/gridtableview-object/properties/get_isiteminserted()%})** |A Boolean property. It gets a value indicating if the **GridTableView** is currently in insert mode.|
| **[.get_pageSize()]({%slug grid/client-side-programming/gridtableview-object/properties/get_pagesize()%})** |Returns the page size for the respective **GridTableView** object.|
| **[.set_pageSize()]({%slug grid/client-side-programming/gridtableview-object/properties/set_pagesize()%})** |Sets the page size for the respective **GridTableView** object.|
| **[.get_currentPageIndex()]({%slug grid/client-side-programming/gridtableview-object/properties/get_currentpageindex()%})** |Returns the current page index for the respective **GridTableView** object.|
| **[.set_currentPageIndex()]({%slug grid/client-side-programming/gridtableview-object/properties/set_currentpageindex()%})** |Sets the current page index for the respective **GridTableView** object.|
| **[.get_pageCount()]({%slug grid/client-side-programming/gridtableview-object/properties/get_pagecount()%})** |Returns the page count for the respective **GridTableView** object.|
| **[.get_clientDataKeyNames()]({%slug grid/client-side-programming/gridtableview-object/properties/get_clientdatakeynames()%})** |A one-dimensional array that holds the key fields set through the **ClientDataKeyNames** property of **GridTableView** on the server. To extract the key values you can use the *eventArgs.getDataKeyValue* inside any row-related client event handler of **RadGrid** .|
| **[.get_parentView()]({%slug grid/client-side-programming/gridtableview-object/properties/get_parentview()%})** |If called from a nested table view, it returns the parent table view (of type **GridTableView** ) in the grid hierarchy; it returns null if called from the **MasterTableView** .|
| **[.get_parentRow()]({%slug grid/client-side-programming/gridtableview-object/properties/get_parentrow()%})** |If called from a nested table view, it returns the parent row (HTML table row - <tr>) for the current nested hierarchical table view; it returns null if called from the **MasterTableView** .|
| **[.get_virtualItemCount()]({%slug grid/client-side-programming/gridtableview-object/properties/get_virtualitemcount()%})** |Gets the virtual item count value for the respective **GridTableView** object. Applies to client-side bound grid only.|
| **[.set_virtualItemCount()]({%slug grid/client-side-programming/gridtableview-object/properties/set_virtualitemcount()%})** |Sets the virtual item count value for the respective **GridTableView** object. Applies to client-side bound grid only.|

>tip For performance reasons, the <GridTableViewInstance>.get_dataItems() collection will be available only when you enable specific client features/events for the rows in the grid (such as **AllowRowResize** , **AllowRowSelect** , **OnRowClick** , etc.).
>


>tip If you want to reference the client object of a grid row inside a client event handler of **RadGrid** , make sure that you attach the **RowCreated** event of the control specifying an empty event handler,
>otherwise *eventArgs.get_gridDataItem()* will return null. This is due to performance reasons (avoiding the client serialization of grid items by default).
>An alternative method to reference a grid row client-side is through the [get_dataItems()]({%slug grid/client-side-programming/gridtableview-object/properties/get_dataitems()%}) collection.

## Client-side Events

Inside each **RadGrid** client event handler the first argument passed (sender) will point to the grid client object. The second argument (eventArgs) will hold reference properties/objects dependable on the respective client event.

## Obtaining GridTableView Elements

You can refer to the elements of the **RadGridTable** using the functions below:

* **<GridTableViewInstance>.get_columns()[n].get_element() ->** the real HTML table column for the **n**-th column****(**<th>** for header cell)

* **<GridTableViewInstance>.get_dataItems()[n].get_element() ->** the real HTML table row for the **n**-th row (**<tr>** element)

## Manipulating GridTableView Elements

In the list below you can find links to the **GridTableView**, **GridColumn** and **GridDataItem** class members articles that list the various methods and properties which you can use for execution additional logic.

* [GridTableView]({%slug grid/client-side-programming/gridtableview-object/gridtableview-class-members%})

* [GridColumn]({%slug grid/client-side-programming/gridcolumn-object/gridcolumn-class-members%})

* [GridDataItem]({%slug grid/client-side-programming/griddataitem-object/griddataitem-class-members%})
