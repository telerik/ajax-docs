Telerik.Web.UI.GridDataItemEventArgs OnRowDeselected Property

>note To get or set property values for client API properties, you must call property accessor methods that are named with the get_ and set_ prefixes. For example, to get or set a value for a property such as [cancel](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb310859.aspx), you call the get_cancel or set_cancel.
>

````ASP.NET
<telerik:RadGrid RenderMode="Lightweight" ID="RadGrid1" runat="server">
    <ClientSettings>
        <ClientEvents OnRowDeselected="RowDeselected" />
    </ClientSettings>
</telerik:RadGrid>
````



````JavaScript
function RowDeselected(sender, eventArgs) {
    alert("Row: " + eventArgs.get_itemIndexHierarchical() + " was deselected");
