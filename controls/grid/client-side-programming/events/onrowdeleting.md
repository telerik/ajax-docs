# OnRowDeleting



## 

Telerik.Web.UI.GridDataItemCancelEventArgs OnRowDeleting Property

>note To get or set property values for client API properties, you must call property accessor methods that are named with the get_ and set_ prefixes. For example, to get or set a value for a property such as [cancel](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb310859.aspx), you call the get_cancel or set_cancel.
>


This event is fired when a row is going to be deleted client-side (GridClientDeleteColumn).

Example:

````ASP.NET
<telerik:RadGrid RenderMode="Lightweight" ID="RadGrid1" runat="server">
    <ClientSettings>
        <ClientEvents OnRowDeleting="RowDeleting" />
    </ClientSettings>
</telerik:RadGrid>
````



````JavaScript
function RowDeleting(sender, eventArgs) {
    alert(eventArgs.getDataKeyValue("OrderID"));

>note get_gridDataItem() is not directly available on the client unless OnRowCreating/OnRowCreated events are hooked up. This is done for optimization purpose. If you need the rowIndex, you can use eventArgs.get_itemIndexHierarchical()
