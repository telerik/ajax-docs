# Functional Items



Functional items are static rows in the grid that perform some function.

## Pager Item

The [Pager]({%slug grid/functionality/paging/pager-item%}) is a row that contains the paging navigation controls. To have the grid divide its data into pages, set the grid's **AllowPaging** property to **True**.

You can define the style of the Pager Row using the [ RadGrid property builder ]({%slug grid/design-time/overview%}) or the **PagerStyle** section of the **RadGrid** property pane.

## CommandItem

The CommandItem is a place holder for commands that can perform some action on the items in the grid. Commands can be processed on the selected items, or on all items in the grid. See the [Command reference]({%slug grid/control-lifecycle/command-reference-%}) topic for details about the available commands you can add to the **CommndItem**.

## StatusBarItem

The GridStatusBarItem appears below all other items in the grid and displays the information about the current grid status. This item is intended primarily for use when **RadGrid** is used with **RadAjaxManager** to indicate when **RadGrid** is performing asynchronous AJAX requests. To show the status bar item, set the grid's **ShowStatusBar** property to **True**.
