# Set style on mouse over

Sometimes, it may be necessary to style a given row/header in Telerik RadGrid, whenever the user hovers with the mouse over it. With RadGrid this functionality is easily achievable. The control provides a CSS class like *GridRowOver_<SkinName>*. Such style is present under each embedded skin and defines the visual appearance of the hovered grid row. For example:

````CSS
.GridRowOver_[SkinName]
{
background-color: orange;
cursor:pointer;
}
````



To enable the hover style for the grid rows, merely set the **ClientSettings -> EnableRowHoverStyle** property of RadGrid to true.

>note This depends on RadGrid client-side object. For performance reasons, the RadGrid client object is available only when certain client features/events are enabled. If no client features/events are available in the grid but you still need this functionality, you can attach an empty javascript function to a client event (for example OnRowClick).
>


If you want to attain the same functionality without the built-in feature of RadGrid for ASP.NET AJAX or with disabled skins, the steps below show how to achieve this:

1. Create the Telerik RadGrid instance and the data source to which it will be bound.

2. Create a style class, in the head section of the .aspx code, which will be used to style the active row/header. This may look something like this:

	**CSS**
	
	<style type="text/css">
	  .RowMouseOver td
	  {
	    background-color: lightblue !important;
	  }
	  .RowMouseOut
	  {
	    /*this style is taken from the corresponding skin's GridRow_[SkinName] class - GridRow_Default in our case*/
	    background: #f7f7f7;
	  }
	  .HeaderMouseOver
	  {
	    background-color: lightblue !important;
	  }
	  .HeaderMouseOut
	  {
	    /*this style is taken from the corresponding skin's th.GridHeader class - th.GridHeader_Default in our case*/
	    background: white url('Img/GridHeaderBg.gif') repeat-x bottom;
	  }
	</style>


3. This particular approach relies on the **OnRowMouseOver**, **OnRowMouseOut**, **OnColumnMouseOver** and **OnColumnMouseOut** client-side functions, to use the style mentioned above. Declare these functions in the **ClientSettings ->ClientEvents** section of the grid declaration like this:

	**ASP.NET**
	
	<ClientSettings>
	    <ClientEvents OnRowMouseOver="RowMouseOver" OnRowMouseOut="RowMouseOut" OnColumnMouseOver="ColumnMouseOver"
	        OnColumnMouseOut="ColumnMouseOut" />
	</ClientSettings>


4. Before the grid tag on the page or in the head section, include the client-side JavaScript functions mentioned above:

	**JavaScript**

	<script type="text/javascript">
	function RowMouseOver(sender, eventArgs) {
	  $get(eventArgs.get_id()).className = "RowMouseOver";
	}
	function RowMouseOut(sender, eventArgs) {
	  $get(eventArgs.get_id()).className = "RowMouseOut";
	}
	function ColumnMouseOver(sender, eventArgs) {
	  eventArgs.get_gridColumn().get_element().className = "HeaderMouseOver";
	}
	function ColumnMouseOut(sender, eventArgs) {
	  eventArgs.get_gridColumn().get_element().className = "HeaderMouseOut";
	}
	</script>


After these steps have been performed, when the user hovers with the mouse over the control, the styles mentioned above will be applied, as shown in the following screenshot:
