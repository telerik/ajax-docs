# Custom Paging



## 

There are cases in which you may want to fetch only a fixed number of records and perform operations on this limited set of data. **RadGrid** allows such data manipulation through its integrated custom paging mechanism.

To use the custom paging mechanism:

1. Set the grid or table view's **AllowPaging** and **AllowCustomPaging** properties to **True**.

2. Set the table view's **VirtualItemCount** property to the total number of records that the grid can draw on. This allows the pager item to correctly represent the size of the pages you implement relative to the total number of records possible.

3. Bind your grid using [the NeedDataSource event]({%slug grid/data-binding/understanding-data-binding/server-side-binding/advanced-data-binding-(using-needdatasource-event)%}). In the **NeedDataSource** event handler, implement code logic to extract the desired fixed number of records, based on the **PageSize** and **CurrentPageIndex** properties of the grid or table view.

>caution  **PageSizeChanged** event fires twice when AllowPaging is true for the RadGrid. To workaround this behaviour you should disable paging for the grid and enable it for the MasterTableView only.
>


>note When custom paging is enabled, the grid's default paging mechanism is disabled.
>


When you enable custom paging, **RadGrid** maintains the pager buttons, updating the pager item in response to user actions, and other presentation specifics. You need only provide the logic of fetching the desired set of records in the **NeedDataSource** event handler.

>note Another option for custom paging is possible when using [declarative binding]({%slug grid/data-binding/understanding-data-binding/server-side-binding/declarative-datasource%}) to an **ObjectDataSource** that supports its own paging mechanism.
