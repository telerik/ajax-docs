# Selecting Cells and Columns



## 

Apart from row selection RadGrid supports the selection of individual cells and columns in the grid table. The cell selection functionality is controlled through the ClientSettings.Selecting.CellSelectionMode property:

* **SingleCell** switches on the single cell selection.

* **MultiCell** turns on multiple cell selection.

* **Column** gives you the opportunity to select all the cells withing a given column by clicking on its header or using the column selection API (server and client side).

* **MultiColumn** takes the column selection one step further and equips the grid with the ability to support multiple column selection.

N.B.: The selection state of RadGrid's cells is persisted on postback but not on rebinding of the grid.

>note To select cells in **DetailTables** of **Hierarchical RadGrid** you can follow the approach from [Select cells in RadGrid with Hierarchy](https://www.telerik.com/support/code-library/select-cells-in-radgrid-with-hierarchy) Code Library article
