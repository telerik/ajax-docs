# Create RadGrid Overview 


### Using the Designer

Creating a RadGrid can be as simple as Dragging and Dropping controls into a page, see **[Designer Overview]({%slug grid/design-time/overview%})**

### Declaratively

While the Designer is very helpful to help Get Started working with RadGrid, the developers are limited to its available options. In order to have more control over the Grid structure, working with the markup directly would be the answer, see **[Declarative Definitions]({%slug grid/create-radgrid/declarative-definition%})** section.

### Programmatically

Often, the business requirements or the scenario will demand creating the controls dynamically. For that, visit the **[Create RadGrid Programmatically]({%slug grid/create-radgrid/creating-a-radgrid-programmatically%})** section.

Once you have a Grid either created Declaratively or Programmatically, you could change its structure Dynamically using different techniques, see **[Changing the Grid Structure Dynamically on Postback]({%slug grid/create-radgrid/changing-the-grid-structure-dynamically-on-postback%})**

### RadGrid as WebUserControl

You can also create re-usable WebUserControl containing RadGrid and load that into one or more pages. See instructions on **[How To Load RadGrid as a WebUserControl]({%slug grid/create-radgrid/loading-user-control-with-telerik-radgrid-at-runtime%})**
