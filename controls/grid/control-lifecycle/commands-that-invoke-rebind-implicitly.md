|  **Command**  **Name**  |  **Field**  |
| ------ | ------ |
|ExpandCollapse|RadGrid.ExpandCollapseCommandName|
|Update|RadGrid.UpdateCommandName|
|Cancel|RadGrid.CancelCommandName|
|Delete|RadGrid.DeleteCommandName|
|Edit|RadGrid.EditCommandName|
|InitInsert|RadGrid.InitInsertCommandName|
|PerformInsert|RadGrid.PerformInsertCommandName|
|RebindGrid|RadGrid.RebindGridCommandName|
|Page|RadGrid.PageCommandName|
|Sort|RadGrid.SortCommandName|
|Filter|RadGrid.FilterCommandName|
|Note that the following commands **do not** perform internal rebind:||
|Select|RadGrid.SelectCommandName|
|Deselect|RadGrid.DeselectCommandName|

>note When RadGrid's ViewState is turned off, the NeedDataSource event does not fire after any of the above listed commands. This is so because it fires after Page_Load and the control already has a DataSource assigned when the command takes place. If you want to make the event fire in such scenarios, you need to first set RadGrid's DataSource to null/Nothing and then call Rebind().
