## Attaching the event

In the Markup

````ASP.NET
<telerik:RadGrid ID="RadGrid1" runat="server" OnNeedDataSource="RadGrid1_NeedDataSource">
</telerik:RadGrid>
````

In the Code behind

````C#
protected void Page_Init(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    RadGrid1.NeedDataSource += RadGrid1_NeedDataSource;
}
````
````VB
Protected Sub Page_Init(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles Me.Init
    AddHandler RadGrid1.NeedDataSource, AddressOf RadGrid1_NeedDataSource
End Sub
````

The event handler

````C#
protected void RadGrid1_NeedDataSource(object sender, GridNeedDataSourceEventArgs e)
{
    bool isFromDetailTable = e.IsFromDetailTable;
    GridRebindReason rebindReason= e.RebindReason;
    int rowsCount = e.RowsCount;
    int startRowIndex = e.StartRowIndex;
}
````
````VB
Protected Sub RadGrid1_NeedDataSource(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As GridNeedDataSourceEventArgs)
    Dim isFromDetailTable As Boolean = e.IsFromDetailTable
    Dim rebindReason As GridRebindReason = e.RebindReason
    Dim rowsCount As Integer = e.RowsCount
    Dim startRowIndex As Integer = e.StartRowIndex
End Sub
````
