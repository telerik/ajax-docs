# Disposed Event

Fired when a server control is released from the memory, which is the last stage of the server control lifecycle when an ASP.NET page is requested.

This event is inherited from the ASP GridView. For more information please check out the [Implementing a Dispose method](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/garbage-collection/implementing-dispose)

"*You implement a Dispose method to release unmanaged resources used by your application.*"
