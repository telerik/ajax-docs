# Key Features



## ![](images/grd_radgrid_default_thumb.png)

1. [Cross-Browser Support](http://www.telerik.com/aspnet-ajax/tech-sheets/browser-support) - Telerik RadGrid supports the full set of features on most popular browsers like Internet Explorer, Gecko-based browsers (Mozilla, Firefox, Netscape), Opera, Safari and Chrome.

1. [Accessibility Support](http://www.telerik.com/help/aspnet-ajax/grid-accessibility-compliance.html) - RadGrid has **level A** W3C compliance and [Section 508 compliance](http://demos.telerik.com/aspnet-ajax/grid/examples/generalfeatures/accessibility/defaultcs.aspx) in conformance with the Section 508 standards listed on the [official government site](http://www.section508.gov/).

1. [Hierarchical Structure of Tables with mixed load modes](http://demos.telerik.com/aspnet-ajax/grid/examples/hierarchy/hierarchyloadmodemixed/defaultcs.aspx), [templates for detail tables](http://demos.telerik.com/ASPNET/Prometheus/Grid/Examples/Hierarchy/NestedViewTemplate/DefaultCS.aspx) - Telerik RadGrid allows presentation of related DataSets as hierarchical structures of tables. **Unique:** You can even have more than one table in the same level of hierarchy or define templates for child tables.

    [See a live example at www.telerik.com](http://demos.telerik.com/aspnet-ajax/Grid/Examples/Hierarchy/ThreeLevel/DefaultCS.aspx)

1. [Global item template](http://demos.telerik.com/ASPNET/Prometheus/Grid/Examples/GeneralFeatures/CardView/DefaultCS.aspx) - allows you to specify item template for each record in the grid and define custom layout to visualize the data in the control.

1. [Integration with RadAjax and loading indicators]({%slug ajaxmanager/overview%}) - dramatically improves the responsiveness of the component, simulates Windows-application like behavior, and minimizes the traffic to the server.

1. [Codeless data-binding]({%slug grid/data-editing/automatic-datasource-operations%}) - using the DataSourceControls introduced in ASP.NET 2.x/3x.

1. [Client-side binding](http://demos.telerik.com/ASPNET/Prometheus/Grid/Examples/Client/DataBinding/DefaultCS.aspx) - RadGrid allows you to bind it to data on the client and perform sorting/paging/filtering operations purely client-side.[Various data sources](http://demos.telerik.com/ASPNET/Prometheus/Grid/Examples/Programming/Binding/DefaultCS.aspx) - Telerik RadGrid supports binding to any data source which implements **IList**, **IEnumerable** of **ICustomTypeDescriptor** interfaces.

1. [Filtering]({%slug grid/functionality/filtering/overview%}) - allows you to filter the data in the control by applying filter pattern on a per column basis.

    ![Filtering](images/grd_Filtering.png)

1. [Header context menu](http://demos.telerik.com/ASPNET/Prometheus/Grid/Examples/GeneralFeatures/HeaderContextMenu/DefaultCS.aspx) - quite useful if you would like to process operations like sorting or grouping on a per-column basis or show/hide some of the grid columns based on the end user preferences.

1. [ Grouping with group footers/footer aggregates ]({%slug grid/functionality/grouping/overview%}) - you can easily implement multilevel Outlook-style grouping of data from a single table - just drag the column header(s) to the group panel on the top, which defines the groping order and hierarchy. You can also programmatically group the data using the group-by expressions. **Unique:** when using grouped data, you can have grouping by two columns and at the same time use all sorting features of Telerik RadGrid (e.g. group by one/two column(s) and sort by another column).

    ![Grouping](images/grd_Grouping.png)

    [See a live example at www.telerik.com](http://demos.telerik.com/aspnet-ajax/Grid/Examples/GroupBy/OutlookStyle/DefaultCS.aspx)

1. [Multi-Column Sorting]({%slug grid/functionality/sorting/multi-column-sorting%}) - in addition to the simple one-column sorting Telerik RadGrid allows you to sort data by several columns just like in Microsoft Excel. Furthermore, you can define column sorted color for better user experience.

    ![Multi-Column Sorting](images/grd_MultiColumnSort.png)

    [See a live example at www.telerik.com](http://demos.telerik.com/aspnet-ajax/Grid/Examples/GeneralFeatures/Sorting/DefaultCS.aspx)

1. [Viewstate Optimization]({%slug grid/hierarchical-grid-types-and-load-modes/hierarchy-load-modes%}) - you can tune the grid performance by controlling the trade-off between client-side load and speed. When working with hierarchical data, you can choose one of the three available modes for loading the detail tables:- **ServerBind** - optimum server load, viewstate and render size.- **ServerOnDemand** - minimum viewstate and render-size, maximum server load.- **Client** - minimum server load, maximum viewstate and render-size. Rich client browser functionality.

1. [ControlState ASP.NET 2.x feature]({%slug grid/performance/optimizing-viewstate-usage%}) - even with viewstate disabled explicitly RadGrid will keep track of its most common features and will save/recover its state on postback requests from its control state storage.[See a live example at www.telerik.com](http://demos.telerik.com/aspnet-ajax/Grid/Examples/Programming/ViewState/DefaultCS.aspx)

1. **Preserving the Grid State After Postback** - an unique feature of Telerik RadGrid is the ability to preserve its appearance, group-by state, sorting, current page, edit or selected state, and resizing after postbacks with minimum resource usage. This significantly improves the usability of the component.

1. [AJAX-based Virtual Scrolling]({%slug grid/functionality/scrolling/virtual-scrolling%}) - for instant navigation in large data structures.

1. [Easy Migration from MS GridView to Telerik RadGrid](http://demos.telerik.com/aspnet-ajax/Grid/Examples/GeneralFeatures/Migration/DefaultCS.aspx)**-** the declarative syntax of Telerik RadGrid is quite similar to that of the DataGrid control, which makes the migration a pretty straightforward task.

1. [Rich Set of Column Types]({%slug grid/columns/column-types%}) - Telerik RadGrid supports all widely used column types (GridEditCommandColumn, GridBoundColumn, GridCheckBoxColumn, GridDropDownColumn, GridButtonColumn, GridHyperLinkColumn, GridClientSelectColumn, etc.), columns with other Telerik controls as column editors (GridDateTimeColumn, GridNumericColumn, GridMaskedColumn, GridHTMLEditorColumn) as well as GridTemplateColumns, which give you complete freedom over the data layout and formatting.
