# Filtering



## Filtering

As of **Q2 2013** we introduced the filtering functionality in the RadDropDownTree. It is enabled through the **EnableFiltering** property of the RadDropDownTree control. By using the following **FilterSettings** the user can further customize the functionality:

>note Note that the filtering functionality can not be used in a combination with WebService and it is not case sensitive.

**Filter**

The **Filter** property accepts two values:

* **Contains** - returns all nodes whose Texts' values contain the searched text as a substring;

* **StartsWith** - is the **default** value of the **Filter** property. It returns all nodes whose text start with the searched (typed) text.

**EmptyMessage**

By using the **EmptyMessage** property you can set a message in the filtering input to provide a hint to the user. Below is an example demonstrating the use of the property:

**FilterTemplate**

This property is used when a template is applied to the node.

* **ByContent** - when the **FilterTemplate** is set to the **ByContent** value, the filtering is implemented in the content itself (the text that is bound to the node and the content of the template, it there are additional controls)

* **ByText** - filters only by the text that is bound to the text of the node.

**Highlight**

* **Matches** - enables highlighting of the node when a match to the typed text is found;

* **None** - does not highlight text when a match of the typed text is found.

**MinFilterLength**

This property defines how many letters need to be typed in in the filter input before the nodes in the dropdown tree to get filtered.
