You can take advantage of the additional functionality that we implemented with the RadDropDownTree control by using the **DropDownSettings**:

* **AutoWidth** - enlarges and shrinks the width of the dropdown when nodes are expanded and collapsed respectively;

* **OpenDropDownOnLoad** - opens the dropdown when the page is loaded;

* **CloseDropDownOnSelection** - this property is added since Q1 2014 -it closes the dropdown automatically when a new entry is selected;

* **CssClass** - sets a custom css class that enables the used to alter the appearance of the dropdown.
