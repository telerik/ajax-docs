# WebForms DropDownTree Overview

The **RadDropDownTree** control is a combination of a lightweight dropdown and a tree control. In the RadDropDownTree we use the approach with entries. Basically, a new entry is created as a result of node's selection from the tree.

## Main features of the RadDropDownTree

Some of the main features of the RadDropDownTree control include:

* Various **DataBindings** including declarative binding, binding to **Entity DataSource** as well as **Linq DataSource**

* **Templates** such as **Header Template**, **Footer Template** and **Node Template**.

* **Checkboxes** that enable the user to choose between the different states - *None*, *SingleCheck*, *TriState* and *CheckChildNodes*.

* **EmptyMessage** that allows the developer to provide a hint (setting a message in the entry area) to the end-user of the application.

* **DropDownSettings** for fine tuning of the control (like *OpenDropDownOnLoad*, which expands the dropdown after it is loaded on the page).
