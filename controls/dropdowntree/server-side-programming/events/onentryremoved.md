# OnEntryRemoved



## 

The server-side **OnEntryRemoved** event occurs when an entry is removed from the entry area, causing a postback.

The event handler receives two parameters:

1. The instance of the **DropDownTree** firing the event

2. An event argument parameter that contains the following property:

	* **Entry** - returns the entry that has just being removed from the input.
