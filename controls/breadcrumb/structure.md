# Structure

The structure of the **RadBreadcrumb** control is as follows:

![Icon types](images/breadcrumb-structure-elements.png)

The Breadcrumb consists of items separated by a **DelimiterIcon**. The items are represented as **BreadcrumbItem** instances. Each of them can hold `Icon`, `Text`, navigational URL (`Href`), and custom attributes. 

Two types of items are exposed  - **RootItem** and **Item**:

* The **RootItem** by default is rendered as a clickable icon - the **Root Icon**.
* Each **Item** by default is rendered with its text only. Items can also have their own icons - **Item Icon**.

More detailed information about the items and icons in RadBreadcrumb you can find in the respective documentation articles:

* [Items]({%slug breadcrumb/functionality/items%})
* [Icons]({%slug breadcrumb/functionality/icons%})
