# Localization

The **RadSlider** has three tooltips that may require localization - on the increase/decrease buttons and on the drag handle. The strings that will be displayed can be controlled with the following properties:

* **DecreaseText** - the tooltip for the decrease button

* **IncreaseText** - the tooltip for the increase button

* **DragText** - the tooltip for the drag handle

These properties can be set to the desired string directly in the markup of the control, in the code-behind or via global resources in the markup to match the rest of the site's localization.
