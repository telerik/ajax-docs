# Mobile Support Overview

**RadToggleButton** for ASP.NET AJAX is a mobile-friendly control that works on wide screens as well as on smaller screens. By design, the control has lightweight rendering that is based on the latest web technology (i.e., HTML5 and CSS3).

To facilitate responsive web page design, **RadToggleButton** offers [Elastic design]({%slug togglebutton/mobile-support/elastic-design%}) and [Fluid design]({%slug togglebutton/mobile-support/fluid-design%}) features. <<Comment: This article doesn't explain why a customer would choose elastic design or fluid design, or how they would do that. What is the difference between them? Is there a property in RadToggleButton to switch between the two types of design? Why would a person choose one over the other?>>
