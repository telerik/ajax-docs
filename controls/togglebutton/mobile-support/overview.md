# Mobile Support Overview

**RadToggleButton** for ASP.NET AJAX is a mobile-friendly control that works on wide screens as well as on smaller screens. By design, the control has lightweight rendering that is based on the latest web technology (i.e., HTML5 and CSS3).

To facilitate responsive web page design (the page and its content adapts automatically to different screen resolutions), **RadToggleButton** offers:

* [Elastic design]({%slug togglebutton/mobile-support/elastic-design%}) -  The elastic design lets the **RadToggleButton** and its elements resize according to a predefined font size.
	
* [Fluid design]({%slug togglebutton/mobile-support/fluid-design%}) - The fluid design lets the **RadToggleButton** resize in percentage according to its wrapper element's dimensions in real-time.
