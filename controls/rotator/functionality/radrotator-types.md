# RadRotator Types



## 

**RadRotator for ASP.NET AJAX** offers 6 types that allow you to change its look and functionality with a single property - **RotatorType**:

1. **AutomaticAdvance** - Items are scrolled automatically in the desired direction. Each item is shown for a specific amount of time.

1. **Buttons** - For each scroll direction the rotator will display a control button. The user needs to click this button to scroll a new item.

1. **ButtonsOver** - For each scroll direction the rotator will display a control button. The user needs to hover over this button with the mouse to scroll new items.

1. **SlideShow** - Like automatic advance, but instead of scrolling, new items are displayed using a transition effect (e.g. Fade).

1. **SlideShowButtons** - For each scroll direction the rotator will display a control button. The user needs to click this button to display a new item.

1. **FromCode** - The rotator will not change items automatically and will not display the control buttons. The developer needs to use the rotator Client API to move items.
