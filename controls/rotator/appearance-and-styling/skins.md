# Skins



Skins control the overall look and feel of a **RadRotator**object. By using Skins consistently, you can make your rotators fit in with the design of the rest of a Web site, increasing usability and attractiveness.

Specify the skin to use by setting the **Skin** property of the **RadRotator**object. You can override this default skin by setting the **Skin** property on an individual **RadRotator**object.

**RadRotator** is installed with a number of preset skins:![RadRotator Skins](images/rotator-skins_thumb.png)

>note The **Hay** , **Forest** , **Sitefinity** and **Transparent** skins are obsolete and have been removed from the Telerik.Web.UI.Skins.dll assembly as of **Q1 2014** .You can find more information on the matter in[this blog post](http://blogs.telerik.com/aspnet-ajax/posts/13-04-11/6-telerik-asp.net-ajax-skins-going-obsolete).
