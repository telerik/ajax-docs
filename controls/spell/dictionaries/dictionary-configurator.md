## 

The Dictionary Configurator tool is useful for creating new dictionary files and editing existing dictionaries. The Dictionary Configurator tool is attached as a web project in the following code-library project: [Dictionary Configuration](http://www.telerik.com/support/code-library/dictionary-configuration).

Using the __Dictionary Configurator__ tool you can:

1. __Import a new dictionary__: Import files are text files, having one word per line with no leading or trailing whitespace.Old TDF files are suitable too.
