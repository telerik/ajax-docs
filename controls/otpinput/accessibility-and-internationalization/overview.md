# OTPInput Accessibility

The OTPInput is accessible by screen readers and provides WAI-ARIA, Section 508, WCAG 2.2, and keyboard support. For more information, refer to [Accessibility](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-jquery-ui/documentation/accessibility/accessibility-overview).

Out of the box, the WebForms OTPInput provides extensive accessibility support and enables users with disabilities to acquire complete control over its features.

The OTPInput is compliant with the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 AA](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) standards and [Section 508](https://www.section508.gov/) requirements, follows the [Web Accessibility Initiative - Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/) best practices for implementing the [keyboard navigation](#keyboard-navigation) for its `component` role, provides options for managing its focus and is tested against the most popular screen readers.

## WAI-ARIA

This section lists the selectors, attributes, and behavior patterns supported by the component and its composite elements, if any. No role attribute is implemented as the `html input type="text"` element is sufficient for defining the purpose of the component.
