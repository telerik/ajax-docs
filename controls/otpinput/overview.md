# WebForms OTPInput Overview

The OTPInput is a UI component that allows the user to enter a one-time password (OTP) during multi-factor authentication. Its sole purpose is to strengthen applications in terms of security while offering a seamless user experience during user interaction.

This component is a server-side, ASP.NET WebForms wrapper over the [Kendo UI OTPInput widget](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-jquery-ui/documentation/controls/otpinput/overview).
