# Filter Overview





Build complex filter expressions in a breeze with **RadFilter** for ASP.NET AJAX. The control allows to specify expressions based on the data type of the source fields and attach them to data-bound controls like **RadGrid** and **RadListView** for ASP.NET AJAX. The visual intuitive UI of **RadFilter** is especially designed to facilitate the end-user and at the same time is powerful enough to create related expressions with a few clicks. Data input filters ensure that the entered filter pattern will be valid and processed accurately.

#### Key features:

* **Visual Expression Building** - Data filtering has never been user-friendlier. With RadFilter, you point-and-click to select your filter options and you are good to go.

* **Seamless Integration** - RadFilter integrates tightly with all .NET 3.5/4.0 data source controls, the RadListView and the RadGrid to enable visual filtering at no programming cost.

* **Filter Any Databound Control** - Filter-enable any databound control with a straightforward connection mechanism.

You can see how the RadFilter works in [its live demos](https://demos.telerik.com/aspnet-ajax/filter/examples/overview/defaultcs.aspx).
