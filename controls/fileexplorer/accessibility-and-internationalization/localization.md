# Localization

The **RadFileExplorer** control uses the same localization mechanism as RadEditor (.resx files in the **App_GlobalResources** folder). If you want to change the localization strings, you need to copy the **RadEditor.Dialogs.resx** file in the **App_GlobalResources** folder of your application and edit the strings inside.
