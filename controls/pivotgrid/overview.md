# PivotGrid Overview



In Q2 2012 SP1 a CTP version of new **RadPivotGrid** control is released. RadPivotGrid is a data summarization control where users can break down raw data in any manner they want.	A pivot table can help quickly summarize the reports and highlight the desired information. It displays data in format such as	spreadsheets or business intelligence applications.

#### Key Features

* **Various field types**

* **Codeless data-binding using the DataSourceControls in ASP.NET 2.0/3.5**

* **Data-Binding to various data sources which implement the IEnumerable, IList, IQueryableor ICustomTypeDescriptor interfaces**

* **Integrated paging**

* **Integrated sorting**

* **Integrated scrolling**

* **Interoperability with RadAjax and loading indicators** - dramatically improves the responsiveness	of the component, simulates Windows-application like behavior, and minimizes the traffic to the server

* **Easily customizable skinning mechanism (setting single Skin property of the pivotgrid)**

* **The expanded state of the items is persisted while navigating through pages.**
