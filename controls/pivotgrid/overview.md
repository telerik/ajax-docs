# PivotGrid Overview



In Q2 2012 SP1 a CTP version of new **RadPivotGrid** control is released. RadPivotGrid is a data summarization control where users can break down raw data in any manner they want.	A pivot table can help quickly summarize the reports and highlight the desired information. It displays data in format such as	spreadsheets or business intelligence applications.

The key features of the RadPivotGrid control are:

* **Various field types**

* **Codeless data-binding using the DataSourceControls in ASP.NET 2.0/3.5**

* **Data-Binding to various data sources which implement the IEnumerable, IList, IQueryableor ICustomTypeDescriptor interfaces**

* **Integrated paging**

* **Integrated sorting**

* **Integrated scrolling**

* **Interoperability with RadAjax and loading indicators** - dramatically improves the responsiveness	of the component, simulates Windows-application like behavior, and minimizes the traffic to the server

* **Easily customizable skinning mechanism (setting single Skin property of the pivotgrid)**

* **The expanded state of the items is persisted while navigating through pages.**
