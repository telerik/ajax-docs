# RadButton Validation and Client-side Event Handlers

When the ASP.NET Validation is used along with a **RadButton** that has client-side event handler attached, an unexpected behavior may occur. The client-side script will be executed before the validation takes place, which is an expected behavior and can be observed with standard Button control as well. As a result the client's script logic won't be executed properly if it relies on postback of the page and the validation is not successful.

To avoid this effect, the client-side method [Page_ClientValidate](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa338815%28v=vs.71%29.aspx) should be utilized. It forces the validation on the client and returns a boolean value, indicating whether it is successful. Using this value you can stop the execution of the client-side function in case the page is not validated. The following example shows how to achieve this.

>note As of Q2 2012 the client-side event **OnClientClicking** is raised after the validation of the page and calling the method **Page_ClientValidate** is no longer needed.

On the ASPX page markup below are added a **TextBox**, which is validated with **RequiredFieldValidator**. The page is submitted through a**RadButton**, that has postback confirmation executed on its **OnClientClicking** event:

````ASP.NET
<asp:TextBox ID="Textbox1" runat="server" />
<asp:RequiredFieldValidator ID="Requiredfieldvalidator1" ErrorMessage="Field is empty!"
		ControlToValidate="Textbox1" runat="server" ValidationGroup="Val" />
<br />
<telerik:RadButton RenderMode="Lightweight" ID="btnStandardConfirm" runat="server" Text="Standard window.confirm"
		OnClientClicking="StandardConfirm" ValidationGroup="Val">
</telerik:RadButton>
````

Below is the JavaScript function, specified as handler of the **OnClientClicking** event.Note that before the main logic is executed, the **Page_ClientValidate** method is used in order to validate the page on the client. If the validation is successful, the confirm dialog is displayed:

````JavaSript
	function StandardConfirm(sender, args) {
		var validated = Page_ClientValidate('Val');
		if (!validated) return;
		args.set_cancel(!window.confirm("Are you sure you want to submit the page?"));
	}
````
