# RadDateTimePicker Overview


The Telerik **RadDateTimePicker** control is composed of **RadDateInput** control, **RadCalendar** and **RadTimeView** controls. **RadDateTimePicker** combines the features of **RadDatePicker** and **RadTimePicker** in a single control for selecting both a date and a time value.

The **RadDateTimePicker** control provides the following features:

* [Client-side API]({%slug datetimepicker/client-side-programming/overview%}) for controlling the date and time pickers without unnecessary postbacks and [client-side events]({%slug datetimepicker/client-side-programming/events/overview%}) on the picker controls and their embedded input controls and popups.

* Complete access to the embedded controls that make up the picker control with the ability to [configure these controls]({%slug datetimepicker/customizing-the-embedded-controls%}) separately.

* [Sharable popup controls]({%slug datetimepicker/functionality/using-shared-radcalendar-radtimeview%}) for smaller rendering and better performance.

* Support for [data-binding]({%slug datetimepicker/data-binding%}).

* Support for localization, including [culture-dependant date formatting]({%slug datetimepicker/accessibility-and-internationalization/specifying-a-culture%}) and the ability to [localize all strings]({%slug calendar/accessibility-and-internationalization/localizing-strings%}) in the user interface.

* [Configurable time view]({%slug datetimepicker/configuring-the-embedded-time-view%}) control for selecting time values.

* Support for [ASP.NET validation controls]({%slug datetimepicker/functionality/validation%}).

* [Keyboard support]({%slug datetimepicker/accessibility-and-internationalization/keyboard-support%}).

* [Template support]({%slug datetimepicker/templates/radtimeview-templates%}) for the time view popup.

* Ability to customize the look-and-feel either by using [skins]({%slug datetimepicker/appearance-and-styling/skins%}) to affect the various parts of the control and its appearance, depending on its state.

* WAI-ARIA Support.
