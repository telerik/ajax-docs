# Specifying a Culture


The **RadDateTimePicker** control support the **System.Globalization** namespace. This namespace consists of classes (**CompareInfo**, **CultureInfo**, **RegionInfo**, etc.) that contain culture-related information such as the language, country/region, sort order for strings, calendars in use, and format patterns for dates, currency, and numbers. They are useful classes for writing internationalized applications.

>caution  
**RadDateTimePicker** supports all the cultures in the System.Globalization namespace that are based on the **Gregorian** calendar.
>

For East Asian, Middle Eastern and other similar cultures, which have an alternative standard for a different Calendar implementation, **RadDateTimePicker** supports their localization and native date and time value representation, but automatically uses the **Gregorian** calendar internally.

## CultureInfo

To specify the culture for a **RadDateTimePicker** control you need to set its **Culture** property.  Note that you can assign a separate **CultureInfo** object to the embedded popup calendar using the **CultureInfo** property of the embedded calendar.

The associated **CultureInfo** object controls:

* The default format for date and time values that the control displays. You can override this pattern by specifying a [date format pattern]({%slug calendar/accessibility-and-internationalization/date-format-patterns%}) as the value of the following properties:

	* **TitleFormat** and **DayCellToolTipFormat** properties of the embedded popup calendar accessed through the **Calendar** property of **RadDateTimePicker**

	* **DateFormat** and **DisplayDateFormat** properties of the embedded **RadDateInput** control accessed through the **DateInput** property
    
    * **TimeFormat** property of the embedded **RadTimeView** control accessed through the **TimeView** property

* The strings used when applying a date format pattern such as month names, day names, separator characters, etc.

* The first day of the week when the **FirstDayOfWeek** property is set to "Default".

* The way **RadDateTimePicker** parses values that the user types into the input area.



## Assigning the culture declaratively

You can assign the culture of a **RadDateTimePicker** control declaratively in the source:

````ASPNET
<telerik:RadDateTimePicker
    ID="RadDateTimePicker1"
    runat="server"
    Culture="French (France)">
    <DateInput Width="100%"></DateInput>
    <DatePopupButton CssClass="radPopupImage_Default" />
    <TimePopupButton CssClass="radPopupImage_Default" />
</telerik:RadDateTimePicker>
````


## Assigning the culture in the code-behind

You can assign a culture property in the code-behind as well:


````C#
protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    RadDateTimePicker1.Culture = new System.Globalization.CultureInfo("en-US", true);
}
````
````VB.NET
Protected Sub Page_Load(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As EventArgs) Handles Me.Load
    RadDateTimePicker1.Culture = New System.Globalization.CultureInfo("en-US", True)
End Sub
````
