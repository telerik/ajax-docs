# Map Overview



__RadMap__ for ASP.NET AJAX is a control powered by the	[Kendo UI DataViz Map](http://demos.telerik.com/kendo-ui/map/index) widget.	This control simplifies the setup of Map Tile Services with	[OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=8/42.745/25.494) and	[Bing](https://www.bingmapsportal.com/).	You can use different Shape layers and GeoJSON data to create helpful map modules in ASP.NET web applications.	The rich built-in functionality of the Map allows you to add and control predefined layouts, markers, tooltips, zoom levels,	UI elements and many more.
