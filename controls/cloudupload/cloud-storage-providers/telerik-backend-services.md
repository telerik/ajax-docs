# Telerik Backend Services

>note Progress decided to discontinue Telerik Platform including its Backend Services and integration with RadCloudUpload. You can find more information on Telerik Platform discontinuation at [Telerik Platform is Retired](https://www.telerik.com/platform-next-level).

[ Telerik Backend Services (formerly Everlive) ](http://www.telerik.com/backend-services) connects your applications to backend cloud storages of Telerik's Cloud Services Platform. Integration with **RadCloudUpload** is easy and requires only an **API Key**.

## Adding References

In order to be able to use the Telerik Backend Services Cloud Storage Provider, you would need the download the **dll files** from [here](https://bs-static.cdn.telerik.com/sdk/latest/windows/EverliveSDK.Windows.Net35.zip).

>note Telerik Backend Services requires reference to **Telerik.Everlive.Sdk.Net35.dll**.
>When Web Application is used the Copy Local property in the Reference Properties dialog box, available from the References pane of the Project Designer must be set to **True** .

In the Configuration Wizard dialog enter Everlive **API Key**. ![cloudupload-everlive-configuration](images/cloudupload-everlive-configuration.png)Specifying the **Uncommitted Files Expiration Period** (TimeSpan Structure), you could easily configure the time, after which the unprocessed files will be removed from the storage.This will add configuration setting in the **web.config** file:
