# Getting Started with the Telerik WebForms CloudUpload



This tutorial will walk you through creating a Web page that uses **RadCloudUpload** control. It shows how to use **RadClodUpload** to upload files.

## Getting Started

1. Create a new page and add a **RadCloudUpload** control to it.

2. Click the Smart Tag of the **RadCloudUpload** control to add **RadScriptManager** to the page:

3. Adding the **RadAScriptManager** will automatically register the **Telerik.Web.UI.WebResource.axd** handler in the web.config file. This handler is used by both **RadScriptManager** and **RadCloudUpload** as demonstrated in the Figure 2. below:

	>caution All Cloud Storage Providers are depending on third party assemblies. To learn how to reference and configure them look at the [Telerik Backend Services (formerly Everlive)]({%slug cloudupload/cloud-storage-providers/telerik-backend-services%}), [AmazonS3]({%slug cloudupload/cloud-storage-providers/amazon-s3%}) or [Azure]({%slug cloudupload/cloud-storage-providers/azure-blob-storage%}) Cloud Storages Sections.
