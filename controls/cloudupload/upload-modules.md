# Upload Modules



## HTML5 File API Module

**File API Module** is the preferred one. It is supported by all modern browsers such as IE10+, FireFox (3.6+), Chrome, Safari (5+), Opera, Safari for MAC. This module offers the richest functionality. When **File API Module** is used, **RadCloudUpload** can use the full functionally providedby the different Cloud Storage Providers. Files are uploaded on chunks in Azure Blob Storage and Amazon S3.

## IFrame Module

**IFrame Module** is used to ensure compatibility for the older browsers, which donâ€™t support HTML5 File API. Such browsers are IE9 or below. When **IFrame Module** files are uploaded at once chunks are not supported.
