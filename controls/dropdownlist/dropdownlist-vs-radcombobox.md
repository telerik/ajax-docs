## What is the best fit for your project?

The difference between each control in a few words:

* **RadDropDownList** – drop-down designed to work with large sets of data.

* **RadComboBox** – text box with auto completion, filtering functionality.

RadDropDownList control works well in either of the cases - when used with small amount of data or with large one. Having that intuitive and lightweightUI is perfect for selection from data list. The RadDropDownList brings a very friendly enhanced mobile experience and keyboard support to the end user. It introduces also a completely new load on demand mechanism - called Virtual Scrolling. On the other hand, the RadComboBox is still the preferred choice for all other drop-down related scenarios with check box support or allowingcustom text.
