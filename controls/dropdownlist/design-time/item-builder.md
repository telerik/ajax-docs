## RadDropDownListItem Properties

For each **RadDropDownListItem**,

* **Text** is the string that the user sees for the item in the drop-down list.

* **Value** is the value associated with the item. It determines the value of the dropdownlist's **SelectedValue** property when the item is selected.

* **ToolTip** is a string that appears in the tooltip window when the user hovers the mouse over the item in the drop-down list.

>tip Setting the tooltip can enable an accessibility feature: Special accessibility readers like JAWS can pronounce the tooltip of the highlighted item.
>


* **Selected** lets you control which item is initially selected when the **RadDropDownList** first appears.

>tip Only one item can be selected at a time. If you set **Selected** to **True** for an item, the **Selected** property of all other items is automatically set to **False** .
>


* **Enabled** determines whether the user can select the item from the drop-down list.

* **CssClass** is the name of a CSS style to be applied to the dropdownlist item. The style can be declared in the CSS file of the applied [skin]({%slug combobox/appearance-and-styling/skins%}).
