# WebForms InputManager Overview





Broadly speaking, there are two groups of controls which are extended using the RadInputManager. The first are controls which are located directly on the page, such as a normal text box somewhere on the form. The second are text boxes located in another control- for example a text box nested in a repeater.

## 

Additionally, within the RadInputManager, there are four types of settings which could be added:

1. **telerik:DateInputSetting** – the targeted text box will be accepting input in a date format

1. **telerik:NumericTextBoxSetting** – the targeted textbox will be accepting numeric input

1. **telerik:RegExpTextBoxSetting** – the targeted text box will be accepting characters corresponding to a specified regular expression

1. **telerik:TextBoxSetting** – the targeted text box will exhibit behavior like a normal RadTextBox

1. **telerik:RadMaskedTextBoxSetting** – the targeted text box will exhibit behavior like a normal RadMaskedTextBox

Each one of these setting groups allows for different behavior. Let us assume that we have two standard textboxes on the form, and we wanted one of them to exhibit behavior similar to a RadTextBox, and the other one as a RadNumericTextBox. In this case, the declaration of the two textboxes, along with the RadInputManager, would look like this:

````ASPNET
<br />
<asp:TextBox ID="TextBox1" runat="server"></asp:TextBox>
<br />
<asp:TextBox ID="TextBox2" runat="server"></asp:TextBox>
<br />
<telerik:RadInputManager RenderMode="Lightweight" ID="RadInputManager1" runat="server">
	<telerik:TextBoxSetting BehaviorID="Setting1" EmptyMessage="EmptyMessage55">
		<TargetControls>
			<telerik:TargetInput ControlID="TextBox1" />
		</TargetControls>
	</telerik:TextBoxSetting>
	<telerik:NumericTextBoxSetting Type="Currency" BehaviorID="Setting2">
		<TargetControls>
			<telerik:TargetInput ControlID="TextBox2" Enabled="true" />
		</TargetControls>
	</telerik:NumericTextBoxSetting>
</telerik:RadInputManager>
````



Each of the Setting tags contains a BehaviorID, which is used to identity settings pertaining to a given text box. These can later be retrieved on the client, for example, and access a property such as the EmptyMessage.



>caution Note that each input setting must have at least one target control, otherwise it will not be serialized to the client and its client object would not be instantiated.
>


Additionally, we can extend text boxes located in other controls. For example, let us assume that we have a repeater hosting a text box. Further, if we want the text box(es) nested in the repeater to accept only e-mail addresses (a regular expression is used to determine this behavior), the setup would look something like:

````ASPNET
<asp:Repeater ID="Repeater1" runat="server">
	<ItemTemplate>
		<br />
		Internet e-mail address:
		<asp:TextBox ID="TextBox1" Text="mailto:e-mail@goes.here" runat="server"></asp:TextBox>
	</ItemTemplate>
</asp:Repeater>
<telerik:RadInputManager RenderMode="Lightweight" ID="RadInputManager1" runat="server">
	<telerik:RegExpTextBoxSetting EmptyMessage="EmptyMessage" BehaviorID="Setting3" ValidationExpression="^\w+([-+.']\w+)*@\w+([-.]\w+)*\.\w+([-.]\w+)*$"
		ErrorMessage="ErrorMessage">
		<TargetControls>
			<telerik:TargetInput ControlID="Repeater1" />
		</TargetControls>
	</telerik:RegExpTextBoxSetting>
</telerik:RadInputManager>
````
