# DataForm Overview


**RadDataForm** is data oriented control, which displays the values of a single record or collection of data items from a DataSource using user-defined templates. You can use the control designer to autogenerate its fields.

The control provides you with an option to preview, edit, delete, and insert records through the available **ItemTemplate**, **EditItemTemplate** and **InsertItemTemplate** templates. The **DataForm** also provides **EmptyDataTemplate**, which applies when the datasource is empty, as well as the **LayoutTemplate** for easy customization.

The control supports the rich set of skins provided by the suite.
