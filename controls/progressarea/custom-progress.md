# Custom Progress



**RadProgressArea** can be used to monitor the progress of any measurable process.

To monitor custom progress:

1. Register [ RadUploadHttpModule and RadUploadProgressHandler ]({%slug progressarea/webconfing-configuraton%}) in web.config.

1. Put a **RadProgressManager** control on the Web page.

1. Put a **RadProgressArea** control on the Web page.
	* Set its **ProgressIndicators** property to include only those controls you want to use. In the **Page_Load** event handler, set the **Localization** property of the **RadProgressArea** object to change the labels so that they reflect your custom process.

1. In the code-behind, when the custom process executes, use the **RadProgressContext.Current** property to access the progress context.
	* At each measurable step of the process, updates the fields of the progress context to indicate the values that **RadProgressArea** should display.

The following table lists the fields of the progress context that you can set:


>caption Â 

| Name | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
|PrimaryTotal|The maximum value of the primary progress indicators. By default, **RadProgressArea** d isplays the request size.|
|PrimaryValue|The current value of the primary progress indicators. By default, **RadProgressArea** displays the uploaded bytes count.|
|PrimaryPercent|The current value of the primary progress, expressed as a percentage of PrimaryTotal.|
|SecondaryTotal|The maximum value of the secondary progress indicators. By default, **RadProgressArea** displays the total number of files.|
|SecondaryValue|The current value of the secondary progress indicators. By default, **RadProgressArea** displays the number of files already uploaded.|
|SecondaryPercent|The current value of the secondary progress, expressed as a percentage of SecondaryTotal.|
|CurrentOperationText|The description of the current operation. By default, **RadProgressArea** displays the name of the currently uploading file.|
|TimeEstimated|The estimated time until the operation completes.|
|TimeElapsed|The time that has elapsed from the beginning of the operation.|
|Speed|The speed of the process. By default, RadProgressArea displays the upload speed.|

>note If you set some of these properties before upload begins, they are not used for file upload monitoring.

## Example

This example shows how to use **RadProgressArea** to display the progress of a custom process:![upload custom progress monitor](images/progress_monitor.png)

The **RadProgressManager** has **SuppressMissingHttpModuleError** set to "true", and the **RadProgressArea** hides the primary progress indicators and **Speed** indicator, as these all provide units to the value that reflect size:

````ASPNET
<telerik:radprogressmanager id="RadProgressManager1" runat="server" />
<telerik:radprogressarea id="RadProgressArea1" runat="server" displaycancelbutton="True"
	progressindicators="FilesCountBar,
						  FilesCount,
						  FilesCountPercent,                      
						  SelectedFilesCount,                      
						  CurrentFileName,                      
						  TimeElapsed,                      
						  TimeEstimated">
</telerik:radprogressarea>
<asp:Button ID="Button1" runat="server" OnClick="Button1_Click" Text="Initiate Process" />
````



In the **Page_Load** event handler, the **Localization** property is set to reflect the new process:





````C#
	     
	
protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
 
   RadProgressArea1.Localization.UploadedFiles = "Completed Steps: ";
   RadProgressArea1.Localization.CurrentFileName = "Step: ";
   RadProgressArea1.Localization.TotalFiles = "Total Steps:";
 
} 
				
````
````VB.NET
	     

Protected Sub Page_Load(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As EventArgs) Handles Me.Load

	RadProgressArea1.Localization.UploadedFiles = "Completed Steps: "
	RadProgressArea1.Localization.CurrentFileName = "Step: "
	RadProgressArea1.Localization.TotalFiles = "Total Steps:"

End Sub
				
````


The button's **Click** event handler performs the lengthy process, and at each measurablestep, updates the progress context:

>tip In addition to the **Dictionary** type, the **RadProgressContext** now offers strongly named properties:
>context["CurrentOperationText"] = "Doing step " + i.ToString();
>is the same as
>context.CurrentOperationText = "Doing step " + i.ToString();
>






````C#
	
	
protected void Button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
	RadProgressContext context = RadProgressContext.Current;
	context.SecondaryTotal = "100";
	for (int i = 1; i < 100; i++)
	{
		context.SecondaryValue = i.ToString();
		context.SecondaryPercent = i.ToString();
		context.CurrentOperationText = "Doing step " + i.ToString();
		if (!Response.IsClientConnected)
		{
			//Cancel button was clicked or the browser was closed, so stop processing
			break;
		}
		// simulate a long time performing the current step
		System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(100);
	}
} 
````
````VB.NET
	     
	
Protected Sub Button1_Click(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As EventArgs) Handles Button1.Click
	Dim context As RadProgressContext = RadProgressContext.Current
	context.SecondaryTotal = "100"
	Dim i As Integer = 1
	While i < 100
		context.SecondaryValue = i.ToString()
		context.SecondaryPercent = i.ToString()
		context.CurrentOperationText = "Doing step " + i.ToString()
		If Not Response.IsClientConnected Then
			'Cancel button was clicked or the browser was closed, so stop processing
			Exit While
		End If
		' simulate a long time performing the current step
		System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(100)
		i = i + 1
	End While
End Sub
