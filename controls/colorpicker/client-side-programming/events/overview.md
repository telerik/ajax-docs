# Events Overview





**RadColorPicker** supports a number of client-side events that let you customize behavior:

* [OnClientLoad]({%slug colorpicker/client-side-programming/events/onclientload%}): occurs after the color picker loads on the page.

* [OnClientColorPreview]({%slug colorpicker/client-side-programming/events/onclientcolorpreview%}): occurs as the mouse hovers over a color box within the palette.

* [OnClientColorChanging]({%slug colorpicker/client-side-programming/events/onclientcolorchanging%}): occurs just before the user selects a color from the palette. Can be cancelled.

* [OnClientColorChange]({%slug colorpicker/client-side-programming/events/onclientcolorchange%}): occurs when the user selects a color from the palette.

* [OnClientPopupShow]({%slug colorpicker/client-side-programming/events/onclientpopupshow%}): occurs after the pop-up palette of a color picker with ShowIcon set to "true" shows.
