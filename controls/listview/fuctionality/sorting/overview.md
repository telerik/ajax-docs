# Sorting Overview



## 

RadListView possesses sorting capabilities that are similar to these, offered by **RadGrid**, so the developers who are familiar with Telerik controls will get used to **RadListView** easily.

Implementing sorting is very easy - you should add a **SortExpression** object to the **SortExpressions** collection as demonstrated on the following example.



````C#
protected void Button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e){
    RadListViewSortExpression expression = new RadListViewSortExpression();
    RadListView1.SortExpressions.Clear();
    expression.FieldName = "myFieldName";
    expression.SortOrder = RadListViewSortOrder.Descending;
    RadListView1.SortExpressions.AddSortExpression(expression);
    RadListView1.Rebind();
}
````
````VB
Protected Sub Button1_Click(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As EventArgs) Handles Button1.Click
    Dim expression As New RadListViewSortExpression()
    RadListView1.SortExpressions.Clear()
    expression.FieldName = "myFieldName"
    expression.SortOrder = RadListViewSortOrder.Descending
    RadListView1.SortExpressions.AddSortExpression(expression)
    RadListView1.Rebind()
End Sub
````


Sorting by multiple fields as well as the natural sorting could be enabled by setting the corresponding properties - AllowMultiFieldSorting and AllowNaturalSort.

To facilitate the users that need a string representation of the sorting expression, we exposed the GetSortString method:



````C#
Label1.Text = RadListView1.SortExpressions.GetSortString();
````
````VB
Label1.Text = RadListView1.SortExpressions.GetSortString()
````


>tip When binding **RadListView** to **ObjectDataSource** control you should set the **OverrideDataSourceControlSorting** property to **true**
