# Tiles Overview



**RadTile** is a flexible UI component that brings the new Windows 8 Start Menu interface into the web applications	and sites. In the previous version of TelerikÂ® UI for ASP.NET AJAX they were used as a set of components in the [RadTileList]({%slug tilelist/overview%}). Since **Q3 2013** the Tiles can be used as a separate control outside of [RadTileList]({%slug tilelist/overview%}).

## Tile Types

The various tile types that are available are:

* [RadContentTemplateTile]({%slug tilelist/tiles/contenttemplate-tile%})

* [RadIconTile]({%slug tilelist/tiles/icon-tile%})

* [RadImageAndTextTile]({%slug tilelist/tiles/imageandtext-tile%})

* [RadImageTile]({%slug tilelist/tiles/image-tile%})

* [RadLiveTile]({%slug tilelist/tiles/live-tile/overview%})

* [RadTextTile]({%slug tilelist/tiles/text-tile%})

## Common settings

The main feature and purpose of the control is [navigation]({%slug tilelist/functionality/navigation%}) and it is controlled through the **NavigateUrl** and **Target** properties.

Each Tile has a **Shape** that controls how its **position and size** according to the other tiles.The possible values are **Square** (the default one, 150x150 pixels) and **Wide**(310x150 pixels).

Tiles can be easily designed and positioned in every part of the document.

[Selection]({%slug tilelist/functionality/selecting%}) of tiles is also a major and can be preselected by using their **Selected** boolean property.

The **Name** property can be used to uniquely identify a tile (e.g. to get a reference to it) or to store some relevant information about it. It is an arbitrary string that should be unique among the collection of tiles. If duplicates are present onlythe first instance will be returned by the control.

The **general appearance** of the tiles is primarily controlled through the specific content set to each of them, yet there are some common properties for each tile:

* **BackColor** will set the background of the tile and will override the default color that comes from the skin

* **ToolTip** can be used to set the title attribute of the tile's HTML element and thus the browser will show a tooltip for it

* Properties like **BorderStyle, BorderWidth, BorderColor, ForeColor, Font-Bold, Font-Size, etc.** can be used to change the appearance of the tile as they toggle the basic CSS properties of its content - border, font, etc.

* Setting the **Width** and **Height** of each tile will override their default size.

	>tip Custom dimensions are supported only for **[standalone tiles](http://demos.telerik.com/aspnet-ajax/tilelist/examples/standalonetiles/defaultcs.aspx)** and they can break the layout when used for tiles inside a **RadTileList**. Tiles used in a **TileList** only support the built-in dimensions (the **Wide** and **Square** options in the **Shape** property).



The [Peek Template]({%slug tilelist/tiles/peek-template%}) inner tag allows the declaration of a secondary content. Its behavior is controlled through the **PeekTemplateSettings inner tag**.

The [Title and Badge]({%slug tilelist/tiles/badge-and-title-elements%}) inner tags allow the developer to control the additional information each of these elements shows on the tile.

Here is an example of what you can achieve with the control:
