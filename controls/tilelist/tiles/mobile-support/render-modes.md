# Render Modes

A **RadTile** has different render modes that can change certain aspects of the control rendering or provide certain advantages. They are exposed via the **RenderMode** property that has four possible values - **Classic**, **Lightweight**, **Mobile** and **Auto**.

The markup a **RadTile** uses is as lightweight and as semantic as possible. The change that may occur is to enable its [elastic design]({%slug tilelist/tiles/mobile-support/elastic-design%}).

The possible options for the **RenderMode** property are:

* @[template](/_templates/common/render-mode.md#classic-desc)

* @[template](/_templates/common/render-mode.md#lightweight-desc) The control is [elastic]({%slug tilelist/tiles/mobile-support/elastic-design%}) and font-icons are used instead of image sprites for the selection indicator and predefined badges.

* @[template](/_templates/common/render-mode.md#mobile-desc)

* @[template](/_templates/common/render-mode.md#auto-desc)

@[template](/_templates/common/render-mode.md#do-not-mix-modes-all "control: RadTile")

>tip **RadTileList** uses **RadTile** controls internally, so all their instances must have the same render mode. Tiles that are children of a TileList will inherit the RenderMode of the TileList.


## Setting Render Mode

There are two ways to configure the rendering mode of the controls:

* The **RenderMode** property in the markup or in the code-behind that can be used for a particular instance:

	__ASP.NET__

		<telerik:RadTextTile ID="RadTextTile1" runat="server" RenderMode="Lightweight">
		</telerik:RadTextTile>


	__C#__

		RadTextTile1.RenderMode = Telerik.Web.UI.RenderMode.Lightweight;

	__VB__

		RadTextTile1.RenderMode = Telerik.Web.UI.RenderMode.Lightweight



* A **global setting in the web.config** file that will affect the entire application, unless a concrete value is specified for a given control instance:

	__XML__

		<appSettings>
			<add key="Telerik.Web.UI.BaseTile.RenderMode" value="Lightweight" />
		</appSettings>

	>tip The key above will affect all RadTile instances. If you want to target specific tile types, use their name in the key instead of `BaseTile`: `TextTile`, `IconTile`, `ImageTile`, `ImageAndTextTile`, `ContentTemplateTile`, `LiveTile`.
