# Render Modes

**RadTileList** has different render modes that can change the behavior of the control under different screen resolutions.	They are exposed via the **RenderMode** property that has four possible values - **Classic**, **Lightweight**, **Mobile** and **Auto**.

The markup **RadTileList** uses is as lightweight and as semantic as possible. The change that may occur is to enable its	[responsive layout]({%slug tilelist/mobile-support/responsive-capabilities%})—if needed, JavaScript code modifies the tiles' containers and CSS	applies a different layout to the control—or to enable its [elastic design]({%slug tilelist/mobile-support/elastic-capabilities%}).

The possible options for the **RenderMode** property are:

* @[template](/_templates/common/render-mode.md#classic-desc)

* @[template](/_templates/common/render-mode.md#lightweight-desc) Тhe control is [elastic]({%slug tilelist/mobile-support/elastic-capabilities%}) and font-icons are used instead of image sprites for the selection indicator and predefined badges.

* **Mobile** - this mode enables the [Responsive layout capabilities]({%slug tilelist/mobile-support/responsive-capabilities%}) of the control.

* **Auto** - this mode makes the control choose the appropriate rendering mode according to the browser. With **RadTileList**, *Mobile* will be set only under mobile devices.

@[template](/_templates/common/render-mode.md#do-not-mix-modes-all "control: RadTileList")

>note **RadTileList** uses **RadTile** controls internally, so all their instances must have the same render mode. Tiles that are children of a TileList will inherit the RenderMode of the TileList.


## Setting Render Mode

There are two ways to configure the rendering mode of the controls:

* The **RenderMode** property in the markup or in the code-behind that can be used for a particular instance:

	__ASP.NET__

		<telerik:RadTileList ID="RadTileList1" runat="server" RenderMode="Mobile">
		</telerik:RadTileList>


	__C#__

		RadTileList1.RenderMode = Telerik.Web.UI.RenderMode.Mobile;

	__VB__

		RadTileList1.RenderMode = Telerik.Web.UI.RenderMode.Mobile



* A **global setting in the web.config** file that will affect the entire application, unless a concrete value is specified for a given control instance:

	__XML__

		<appSettings>
			<add key="Telerik.Web.UI.TileList.RenderMode" value="Mobile" />
		</appSettings>
