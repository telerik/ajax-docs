# WCAG 2.0 and Section 508 Accessibility Compliance





Telerik's **TileList** control satisfies the requirements of **Section 508** and those for **Level A** according to the **W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0**.

**RadTileList** is tested with the **WAVE** and **Compliance Sheriff** automated tools.

By itself, **RadTileList** generates as little markup as possible. When creating content, the developer should make sure that content is accessible to persons with disabilities. This is most important for [Live Tiles]({%slug tilelist/tiles/live-tile/overview%}), [ContentTemplate Tiles]({%slug tilelist/tiles/contenttemplate-tile%}) and the [PeekTemplate]({%slug tilelist/tiles/peek-template%}) where the entire content is designed by the developer.
