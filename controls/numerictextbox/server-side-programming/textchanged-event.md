# TextChanged Event




All **RadInput** controls provide the **TextChanged** server event,which is raised when the **AutoPostBack** property is set to **true**, the user types valid entry, and the input loses focus.

The **TextChanged** event only occurs if the value of the input control actually changes. If the user changes the string in the input control but does not actually change the value (for example, entering a date into **RadDateInput** using a different format or entering an out-of-range number that is automatically corrected to the old value by **RadNumericTextBox**), the **TextChanged** event does not occur.

>tip Note that when using **RadNumericTextBox** , if a value is passed from the server with more digits after the decimal point than you have specified through the **NumberFormat.DecimalDigits** property, on postback the **TextChanged** event will fire, as the rounding done on the client by the RadNumericTextBox in fact changes the initial value. This would happen even when there was no user action on the textbox.
>


>tip The postback request can be controlled for **RadNumericTextBox** by using the OnValueChanged client event of the control.

The **TextChanged** event handler receives two arguments:

1. The **RadInput** control whose value was just changed. This argument is of type object, but can be cast to the appropriate type.

1. An **EventArgs** object.

Use the **TextChanged** event handler to respond to changes in the control's text:



````C#
protected void RadInput_TextChanged(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
	if (sender is RadNumericTextBox)
	{
		RadNumericTextBox ntb = (RadNumericTextBox)sender;
		RadComboBox1.SelectedIndex = ntb.Value;
	}

}
````
````VB.NET
Protected Sub RadInput_TextChanged(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As EventArgs) Handles RadNumericTextBox1.TextChanged
	If TypeOf sender Is RadNumericTextBox Then
		Dim ntb As RadNumericTextBox = DirectCast(sender, RadNumericTextBox)
		RadComboBox1.SelectedIndex = ntb.Value
	End If
End Sub
````
