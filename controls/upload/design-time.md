# Design Time



>caution  **RadUpload** has been replaced by [RadAsyncUpload](http://demos.telerik.com/aspnet-ajax/asyncupload/examples/overview/defaultcs.aspx), Telerik’s next-generation ASP.NET upload component. If you are considering Telerik’s Upload control for new development, check out the [ documentation of RadAsyncUpload ](http://www.telerik.com/help/aspnet-ajax/asyncupload-overview.html) or the [control’s product page](http://www.telerik.com/products/aspnet-ajax/asyncupload.aspx). If you are already using **RadUpload** in your projects, you may be interested in reading how easy the transition to RadAsyncUpload is and how you can benefit from it [in this blog post](http://blogs.telerik.com/blogs/12-12-05/the-case-of-telerik-s-new-old-asp.net-ajax-upload-control-radasyncupload). The official support for **RadUpload** has been discontinued in June 2013 (Q2’13), although it is still be available in the suite. We deeply believe that **RadAsyncUpload** can better serve your upload needs and we kindly ask you to transition to it to make sure you take advantage of its support and the new features we constantly add to it.

The Smart Tag allows easy access to frequently needed tasks. You can display the **Smart Tag** by right clicking on a control in the design window, and choosing **Show Smart Tag** from its context menu.

## RadUpload Smart Tag

The **RadUpload** Smart Tag lets you perform the following:

## Ajax Resources

* **Add RadAjaxManager...** adds a RadAjaxManager component to your Web page, and displays the **r.a.d.ajax Property Builder** where you can configure it.

* **Replace ScriptManager with RadScriptManager** replaces the default **ScriptManager** component that is added for AJAX-enabled Web sites with **RadScriptManager**.

* Add **RadStyleSheetManager** adds a **RadStyleSheetManager** to your Web page.

## Skin

The **Skin** drop-down lets you select from a list of available [skins]({%slug upload/appearance-and-styling/skins%}) to customize the look of your **RadUpload** control.

## Learning Center

Links navigate you directly to **RadUpload** examples, help, or code library. You can also search the Telerik web site for a given string.

## RadProgressManager Smart Tag

As of 2008 Q3 SP1 (2008.3.1125), RadProgressManager can automatically register the [RadUploadHttpModule and RadUploadProgressHandler](FAFFEB65-66D2-4CFE-8F40-E4BA471540A9) in the web.config file.

## RadProgressArea Smart Tag

The RadProgressArea Smart Tag is exactly the same as the **RadUpload** Smart Tag. The **Skin** drop-down is available so that you can choose a skin for the progress dialog that it displays.
