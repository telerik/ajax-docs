# Controlling Appearance



A number of properties let you set the look and feel of the **RadTextBox** controls:

* The **Skin** property lets you specify a [skin]({%slug textbox/appearance-and-styling/skins%}) to set the overall look and feel of the input control.

* In addition to the skin, you can [set a variety of styles]({%slug textbox/appearance-and-styling/styles%}) that let the input control change its appearance depending on whether it is enabled or disabled, is under the mouse, has focus, contains an empty value, or contains an invalid value.

* The **Label** property lets you add a label to the input control.

* The **EmptyMessage** property lets you [specify a string that appears when the user has not entered a value]({%slug textbox/appearance-and-styling/displaying-empty-values%}).

* The **WrapperCssClass** property specifies the CSS class(es) added to the wrapper element of the RadTextBox control.

* The **LabelCssClass** property specifies the CSS class(es) added to the label	of the RadTextBox control.

* The **LabelWidth** property specifies the width of the label.

* The **Width** property specifies the width of the wrapper of the control. The default value is 160px.

* The **TextMode** property specifies whether the text appears in a single line or multiple lines. The **Columns**, **Rows**, and **Wrap** properties further customize the appearance of [multi-line text boxes]({%slug text/appearance-and-styling/multi-line-text-boxes%}).
