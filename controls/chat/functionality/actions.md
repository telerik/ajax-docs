# Default Actions

The **RadChat** control has a support for default **suggested actions** which are rendered inside a Suggested Actions Pane. A **Suggested Action** is a button that the user can tap/click to provide input. That is why they can be also called **Quick Actions**.

Unlike buttons that appear within [rich cards]({%slug chat/functionality/cards%}) (which remain visible and accessible to the user even after being tapped), buttons that appear within the suggested actions pane will disappear after the user makes a selection. This prevents the user from tapping stale buttons within a conversation and simplifies bot development (since you will not need to account for that scenario). 

To display the **suggestedActions** propmt, you need to call  the `renderSuggestedActions` method of the control.

Once the user clicks on an option, the [OnActionClick]({%slug chat/client-side-programming/events/onactionclick%}) event is fired and the [OnPost]({%slug chat/client-side-programming/events/onpost%}) event.
