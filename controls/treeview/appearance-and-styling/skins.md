To make customizing the appearance of RadTreeView as easy as possible, the control uses __skins____.__ A skin is a set of images and a CSS style sheet that can be applied to the TreeView elements (Nodes, images, etc.) and defines their look and feel. To apply a skin to the TreeView, set its __Skin__ property, either using the properties pane or the RadTreeView [Smart Tag]({%slug treeview/design-time/smart-tag%}).

RadTreeView comes with a number of built-in skins:
