# Skins


To make customizing the appearance of **RadTreeView** as easy as possible, the control uses **skins**. A skin is a set of images and a CSS style sheet that can be applied to the **TreeView** elements (Nodes, images, etc.) and defines their look and feel. To apply a skin to the **TreeView**, set its **Skin** property, either using the properties pane or the **RadTreeView** [Smart Tag]({%slug treeview/design-time/smart-tag%}).

**RadTreeView** comes with a number of built-in skins:
