# ImageExported



The client-side **ImageExported** event is raised when the image is already exported by **RadClientExportManager**.

To handle this event, simply write a JavaScript function that can be called when the event occurs. Then assign the name of this function as the value of the the **ImageExported** property.

## 

The client-side **ImageExported** event handler receives one argument:

1. Sender—the [RadClientExportManager object]({%slug clientexportmanager/client-side-programming/overview%}) that fired the event.

1. Event arguments—a **ClientExportManagerImageExportedEventArgs** object.
