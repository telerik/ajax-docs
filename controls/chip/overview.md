# Chip Overview

The Chip is a compact element that represents an input, attribute, or action. The component enables user input and verifies that input by converting text into chips.  

This component is a server-side, ASP.NET WebForms wrapper over the [Kendo UI Chip widget](https://docs.telerik.com/kendo-ui/controls/chip/overview).

The Chip UI component is versatile and can be used in various real-life scenarios across web and mobile applications. Here are some examples:

**In email apps**, Chip UI components can be used to manage recipient lists, where each chip represents a person, allowing for easy addition or removal.

**In social networking or job portals**, chips effectively showcase user skills or interests, offering a concise and interactive way to display and edit these attributes.
