# Controlling RadDock's Appearance



There are a number of ways you can customize the look & feel of your __RadDock__ and __RadDockZone__ controls:

## RadDockZone

* To change the overall look and feel of the __RadDockZone__ control, set its [Skin]({%slug dock/appearance-and-styling/skins%}) property.

* To change [the layout of docked controls]({%slug dock/getting-started/dock-zone-orientation%}) within the __RadDockZone__ control, use the __Orientation__ property.

* To cause the __RadDockZone__ to be [highlighted]({%slug dock/structure/dock-zones/highlighting%}) when the user is dragging a __RadDock__ control over it that can be docked, use the __HighlightedCssClass__ property.

## RadDock

* To change the overall look and feel of the __RadDock__ control, set its [Skin]({%slug dock/appearance-and-styling/skins%}) property.

* To change the visual cues for where the user can start a [drag operation]({%slug dock/getting-started/drag-and-drop%}), use the __DockHandle__ property.

* To [specify the content]({%slug dock/application-scenarios/adding-content-to-raddock%}) that appears inside the __RadDock__ control, use the __ContentTemplate__, the __ContentContainer__ property, or the __Text__ property.

* To customize the appearance and behavior of the title bar, use a [title bar template]({%slug dock/structure/dock/title-bar-template%}).

* To change the [commands]({%slug dock/commands/overview%}) that appear in the __RadDock__ title bar, use the __DefaultCommands__ property or the __Commands__ property collection.

* To change [the appearance of the command icons]({%slug dock/commands/styling-custom-commands%}) on the title bar, use the __CssClass__ property of the command object.

* A range of __Text__properties let you [change the tooltips]({%slug dock/commands/specifying-command-tooltips%}) that appear when the user hovers the mouse over the command icons in the title bar.
