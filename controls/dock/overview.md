# RadDock Overview





The **Telerik Docking controls** consist of **RadDock**, **RadDockZone**, and **RadDockLayout**. Together, they can be used to create ASP.NET applications that contain movable content regions that can be dragged around the Web page, docked into docking zones, collapsed into a minimized state and expanded to display their content, pinned in place, and so on.

* The ability to customize the [drag-and-drop behavior]({%slug dock/getting-started/drag-and-drop%}) of individual **RadDock** controls,including specifying the **DockHandle** that the user clicks on to start a drag operation and controlling where the user can drop a control.
