# WebForms Dock Overview





The **Telerik Docking controls** consist of **RadDock**, **RadDockZone**, and **RadDockLayout**. Together, they can be used to create ASP.NET applications that contain movable content regions that can be dragged around the Web page, docked into docking zones, collapsed into a minimized state and expanded to display their content, pinned in place, and so on. 

#### Key Features

* The ability to customize the [drag-and-drop behavior]({%slug dock/getting-started/drag-and-drop%}) of individual **RadDock** controls,including specifying the **DockHandle** that the user clicks on to start a drag operation and controlling where the user can drop a control.

* Support for adding [Commands]({%slug dock/commands/overview%}) to the **RadDock** title bar and implementing their behavior in a variety of [events]({%slug dock/commands/events-triggered-on-command-execution%}).

* Numerous ways to supply [content]({%slug dock/how-to/adding-content-to-raddock%}) to the RadDock controls.

* The ability to assign CSS classes to [control the appearance of custom commands]({%slug dock/commands/styling-custom-commands%}) or to [highlight docking zones]({%slug dock/structure/dock-zones/highlighting%}) when they can accept a control for docking.

* Options for configuring the way docking zones [lay out their docked controls]({%slug dock/getting-started/dock-zone-orientation%}).

* The ability to [specify tooltips]({%slug dock/commands/specifying-command-tooltips%}) for the commands in the title bar.

* [Server-side events]({%slug dock/server-side-programming/overview%}) that let you [save the layout]({%slug dock/server-side-programming/events/savedocklayout%}) of docked controls in a database or other permanent storage medium and [load it at a later time]({%slug dock/server-side-programming/events/loaddocklayout%}), [respond to commands]({%slug dock/server-side-programming/events/command%}), and [respond when the user changes the layout]({%slug dock/server-side-programming/events/dockpositionchanged%}) of docked controls.
