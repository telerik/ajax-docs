# Sending Additional Information to the Provider

Starting with the Q3 2010 release RadScheduler allows additional information to be sent from the page to each provider method. This is convenient for passing any form of meta-data that is not part of the appointments themselves.

Older versions require the use of a side-channel such as the Session to transfer such meta-data.

## 

Prerquisites

1) In order to be able to receive the information in your provider you must implement the methods that take ISchedulerInfo as parameters. Please see [Provider interface changes in Q3 2010]({%slug scheduler/data-binding/providers/provider-interface-changes-in-q3-2010%})

2) Create a custom ISchedulerInfo implementation by inheriting from SchedulerInfo:

````C#
public class MySchedulerInfo : SchedulerInfo
{
	public string User { get; set; }
	public MySchedulerInfo(ISchedulerInfo baseInfo, string user): base(baseInfo)
	{
		User = user;
	}
}  
````
````VB
Public Class MySchedulerInfo Inherits SchedulerInfo
	Public Property User() As String
		Get
			Return m_User
		End Get

		Set
			m_User = Value
		End Set
	End Property

	Private m_User As String
	
	Public Sub New(baseInfo As ISchedulerInfo, userParam As String)
		MyBase.New(baseInfo)
		User = userParam
	End Sub
End Class  
````

## Sending additional information when using server-side data binding

1) Send the customized MySchedulerInfo to RadScheduler in one of the following events:
	* AppointmentsPopulating
	* ResourcesPopulating
	* AppointmentInsert
	* AppointmentUpdate
	* AppointmentDelete

For example:

````C#
protected void RadScheduler1_AppointmentsPopulating(object sender, AppointmentsPopulatingEventArgs e)
{
	e.SchedulerInfo = new MySchedulerInfo(e.SchedulerInfo, User.Identity.Name);
}
````
````VB
Protected Sub RadScheduler1_AppointmentsPopulating(sender As Object, e As AppointmentsPopulatingEventArgs)
	e.SchedulerInfo = New MySchedulerInfo(e.SchedulerInfo, User.Identity.Name)
End Sub  
````

2) Cast the schedulerInfo to MySchedulerInfo in the corresponding provider method

````C#
public override IEnumerable<Appointment> GetAppointments(ISchedulerInfo schedulerInfo)
{
	var myInfo = schedulerInfo as MySchedulerInfo;
	// Access myInfo.User
	// ...
}     
````
````VB
Public Overrides Function GetAppointments(schedulerInfo As ISchedulerInfo) As IEnumerable(Of Appointment)
	Dim myInfo = TryCast(schedulerInfo, MySchedulerInfo)
	' Access myInfo.User
	' ...
End Function  
````

## Sending additional information when using web-service data binding

1) Follow the instructions in [Sending additional information to the Web Service]({%slug scheduler/web-service-binding/sending-additional-information-to-the-web-service%})

2) Cast the schedulerInfo to MySchedulerInfo in the corresponding provider method

````C#
public override IEnumerable<Appointment> GetAppointments(ISchedulerInfo schedulerInfo)
{
	var myInfo = schedulerInfo as MySchedulerInfo;
	// Access myInfo.User
	// ...
} 
````
````VB
'Getting MySchedulerInfo from GetAppointments Copy Code 
Public Overrides Function GetAppointments(schedulerInfo As ISchedulerInfo) As IEnumerable(Of Appointment)
	Dim myInfo = TryCast(schedulerInfo, MySchedulerInfo)
	' Access myInfo.User
	' ...
End Function  
````
