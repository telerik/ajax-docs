# Exchange Provider



## 

The provider model supported by RadScheduler can be used for synchronization with multitude of data sources. The provider uses Exchange Web Services over HTTP/HTTPS as means to communicate with the Exchange server.

**Distribution**

The Exchange provider is distributed as web site project in our [RadScheduler SDK](https://github.com/telerik/aspnet-sdk/tree/master/Scheduler) and the source code of the provider is located in the App_Code folder.

**Usage**

>tip Please be aware that Reminders functionality is not supported when Exchange provider is used.
>


You are able to instantiate the provider through code. This allows you to provide different server URL and credentials, for example, depending on the current user.

For example:

````C#
	
protected void Page_Init(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
	ExchangeSchedulerProvider provider =
		new ExchangeSchedulerProvider(@"https://yourURL.com/EWS/Exchange.asmx", "username", "password", "domain", "CalendarName");

	// Alternatively, you can pass in existing credentials (NetworkCredential object):
	// new ExchangeSchedulerProvider("https://dc1.litwareinc.com/EWS/Exchange.asmx", credentials);
	RadScheduler1.Provider = provider;
}  
	
````



You can configure the provider entirely declaratively. First you need to add the following configuration section to your web.config file:

````XML
	
<configuration>
   <configSections>
	   <sectionGroup name="telerik.web.ui">
		   <section name="radScheduler"
type="Telerik.Web.UI.RadSchedulerConfigurationSection, Telerik.Web.UI, PublicKeyToken=121fae78165ba3d4"
allowDefinition="MachineToApplication" requirePermission="false"/>
	   </sectionGroup>
   </configSections>
</configuration> 
	
````



Then add the provider section itself. Be sure to specify the correct server URL, username, password and domain:

````XML
	
<configuration>
   <telerik.web.ui>
	   <radScheduler defaultAppointmentProvider="Integrated">
		   <appointmentProviders>
			   <add  name="ExchangeSchedulerProvider" type="Telerik.Web.Examples.Scheduler.ExchangeSchedulerProvider"
serverUrl="https://dc1.litwareinc.com/EWS/Exchange.asmx"
username="wl" password="pass@word1" domain="litwareinc" />
		   </appointmentProviders>
	   </radScheduler>
   </telerik.web.ui>
</configuration> 
	
````



The provider is now set up and will be shared by all RadScheduler instances that are configured to use it. This is done by setting the ProviderName:

````ASPNET
	
<telerik:RadScheduler RenderMode="Lightweight" runat="server" ID="RadScheduler1"
ProviderName="ExchangeSchedulerProvider">
</telerik:RadScheduler>  
	
````
