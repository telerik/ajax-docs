## Dialogs

The RadScheduler confirmation dialogs are used to prevent accidently deleting an appointment or just to choose whether you want to delete/modify the selected occurrence or the whole series of appointments.

In the next few paragraphs you will see most of dialogs you can come across while using the RadScheduler control:

* Confirmation for deleting a not recurrence appointment.
