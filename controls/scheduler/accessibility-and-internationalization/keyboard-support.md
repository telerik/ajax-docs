# Keyboard Support



## 

As of **Q2 2011** RadScheduler introduces keyboard support. In order to activate it, appropriate TabIndex should be set.

The keyboard navigation has the following functionalities:

* Use the Up and Down arrows to move up and down the selected time slot (Day view)

* Use the Up/Down/Right/Left arrows to navigate through timeslots(Month/Week views)

* Use Tab to switch the focus among appointments

* Use Shift + Tab to switch the focus among appointments backwards

* Press Enter to add an appointment when the focus is on a time slot

* Press Enter on existing appointment to trigger edit

* Press Delete on appointment to remove it from the schedule

* Press Esc to cancel insert/update of an Appointment

*	Alt + S saves the appointment

* Alt + C cancels the edit / insertion

* Alt + O opens advanced form

* Use Shift + arrows to select multiple timeslots (like in Outlook)

The available key combinations are listed below:
