# WebForms Scheduler Overview


Using the Telerik **RadScheduler** control, you can build powerful ASP.NET applications to allow users to create and manage tasks. **RadScheduler** displays and edits scheduled appointments that are stored in a separate data source.A variety of [data binding]({%slug scheduler/data-binding/overview%}) options allows you to work with data sources that are as simple or as powerful as you want.

#### Key Features

Using **RadScheduler**, users can

* [Add]({%slug scheduler/usability/adding-appointments%}), [edit]({%slug scheduler/usability/editing-appointments%}),[resize, move, and delete]({%slug scheduler/usability/resizing-moving-and-deleting-appointments%}) appointments.

* Set up recurring appointments, and make exceptions to the recurring series.

* See appointments in [Day, Week, Month, or Resource view]({%slug scheduler/views/overview%}),whichever is most convenient.

* [Navigate]({%slug scheduler/usability/navigating-radscheduler%}) between different representations of the appointment data.

**RadScheduler** is highly configurable, letting you customize the user interface to your purpose. You can

* Use [skins]({%slug scheduler/appearance-and-styling/skins%}) to customize the look and feel of **RadScheduler**.

* Use [templates]({%slug scheduler/appearance-and-styling/templates%}) to customize the appearance of appointments in the scheduler, or the look and behavior of the editors.

* [Replace the edit form]({%slug scheduler/how-to/replace-the-edit-form%}) so that it matches the look and feel of your Web site.

* [Customize the user interface]({%slug scheduler/appearance-and-styling/controlling-appearance%}) to show only those controls you want.

* Add [Custom Resources and Attributes]({%slug scheduler/design-time/custom-resources-and-attributes%}) to make the information you store with appointments as rich as you want.

* [Localize]({%slug scheduler/accessibility-and-internationalization/translating-strings%}) the scheduler for different cultures, including adjusting to different [time zones]({%slug scheduler/accessibility-and-internationalization/handling-time-zones%}).

A rich assortment of both [client-side]({%slug scheduler/client-side-programming/events/overview%}) and [server-side]({%slug scheduler/server-side-programming/server-events/overview%}) events lets you adapt the scheduler's behavior to your own special purposes. The programming API lets you manage [recurring events]({%slug scheduler/server-side-programming/working-with-recurring-appointments%}), [custom resources]({%slug scheduler/server-side-programming/working-with-resources%}), and even interact with the [ICalendar interface]({%slug scheduler/export/export-to-icalendar%}).
