**RadMenu** introduces three server-side events for working with menu items:

* [ItemClick]({%slug menu/server-side-programming/itemclick%}) occurs when the user clicks on a menu item.

* [ItemCreated]({%slug menu/server-side-programming/itemcreated%}) occurs when a new menu item is added to the menu (at any level).

* [ItemDataBound]({%slug menu/server-side-programming/itemdatabound%}) occurs when a menu item is bound to a data source.
