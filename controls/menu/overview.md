# WebForms Menu Overview



**Telerik RadMenu for ASP.NET AJAX** is a flexible navigation component for use in ASP.NET applications.

**Telerik RadContextMenu** is a related control that shares the powerful features of **RadMenu**, but which acts as a context menu or popup menu. 

#### Key Features
Using **RadMenu** and **RadContextMenu**, you get

* A [client-side API]({%slug menu/client-side-programming/overview%}) that includes the ability to add, remove and update menu items and have these changes persist after a postback to the server.

* Numerous options in how to define the item hierarchy, including

* [Defining items statically at design time]({%slug menu/radmenu-items/declaring-items-statically-at-design-time%}).

* [Creating items dynamically in server-side code]({%slug menu/radmenu-items/working-with-items-at-server-side%}).

* [Creating items dynamically in client-side code]({%slug menu/radmenu-items/working-with-items-at-client-side%}).

* [Loading Items from an XML file or string]({%slug menu/radmenu-items/loading-items-from-xml%}).

* [Loading Items from a Web Service]({%slug menu/data-binding/web-service-binding%}).

* [Binding to all ASP.NET declarative DataSource components]({%slug menu/data-binding/overview%}), including **SiteMapDataSource**.

* Extensive [keyboard support]({%slug menu/accessibility-and-internationalization/keyboard-support%}), covering both web (access keys and tab) and windows (arrows).

* Many options for [controlling appearance]({%slug menu/appearance-and-styling/layout-of-root-items-%}), including

* The ability to [add images to items]({%slug menu/appearance-and-styling/adding-images-to-items%})

* Control over the [layout of items]({%slug menu/appearance-and-styling/layout-of-child-items%}).

* [Animations]({%slug menu/functionality/animations%}) to customize the way child items appear and disappear.

* Built-in [skins]({%slug menu/appearance-and-styling/appearance-skins%}) to quickly change the look and feel.

* [Style sheet support for individual items]({%slug menu/appearance-and-styling/setting--the-css-class-of-items%}).
