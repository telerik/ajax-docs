# Menu Overview



**Telerik RadMenu for ASP.NET AJAX** is a flexible navigation component for use in ASP.NET applications.

**Telerik RadContextMenu** is a related control that shares the powerful features of **RadMenu**, but which acts as a context menu or popup menu. 

#### Key Features
Using **RadMenu** and **RadContextMenu**, you get

* A [client-side API]({%slug menu/client-side-programming/overview%}) that includes the ability to add, remove and update menu items and have these changes persist after a postback to the server.

* Numerous options in how to define the item hierarchy, including

* [Defining items statically at design time]({%slug menu/radmenu-items/declaring-items-statically-at-design-time%}).

* [Creating items dynamically in server-side code]({%slug menu/radmenu-items/working-with-items-at-server-side%}).

* [Creating items dynamically in client-side code]({%slug menu/radmenu-items/working-with-items-at-client-side%}).

* [Loading Items from an XML file or string]({%slug menu/radmenu-items/loading-items-from-xml%}).

* [Loading Items from a Web Service]({%slug menu/data-binding/web-service-binding%}).

* Built-in [skins]({%slug menu/appearance-and-styling/appearance-skins%}) to quickly change the look and feel.
