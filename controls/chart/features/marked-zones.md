# Marked Zones

>caution **RadChart** has been deprecated since Q3 2014 and is no longer recommended for use, as it does not support modern browsers. We strongly recommend using [RadHtmlChart](https://www.telerik.com/products/aspnet-ajax/html-chart.aspx), Telerik's modern client-side charting component. 
>To transition from RadChart to RadHtmlChart, refer to the following migration articles:

PlotArea MarkedZones are ranges that can be labeled and filled to highlight areas of the chart or to visually group data. The MarkedZones property by default display behind the chart series. You can create any number of members for the MarkedZones collection and each marked zone is defined by a starting and ending X and Y value pairs. You can also control the labelling and appearance for each zone independently.
