# Strict Mode

>caution **RadChart** has been deprecated since Q3 2014 and is no longer recommended for use, as it does not support modern browsers. We strongly recommend using [RadHtmlChart](https://www.telerik.com/products/aspnet-ajax/html-chart.aspx), Telerik's modern client-side charting component. 
>To transition from RadChart to RadHtmlChart, refer to the following migration articles:

The RadChart bar series now features "strict mode". This is not a property or setting, but a behavior of bar chart series where X values are respected and bars are positioned according to their XValues. If there are no series items with XValues then RadChart resumes standard sequential ordering of each item. The screen shot above was produced using the following X and Y values:

**Series 1**

|  **YValue**  |  **XValue**  |
| ------ | ------ |
|3|0|
|3|1|
|4|3|
|3|3|
|5|4|

**Series 2**

|  **YValue**  |  **XValue**  |
| ------ | ------ |
|1|5|
|2|4|
