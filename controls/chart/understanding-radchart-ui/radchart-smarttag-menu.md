# RadChart SmartTag Menu

>caution **RadChart** has been deprecated since Q3 2014 and is no longer recommended for use, as it does not support modern browsers. We strongly recommend using [RadHtmlChart](https://www.telerik.com/products/aspnet-ajax/html-chart.aspx), Telerik's modern client-side charting component. 
>To transition from RadChart to RadHtmlChart, refer to the following migration articles:
> - [Migrating Series]({%slug htmlchart/changes-and-backwards-compatibility/migrating-from-radchart-to-radhtmlchart/migrate-series-configuration%})
