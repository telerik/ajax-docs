# Building RadCharts Overview

>caution **RadChart** has been deprecated since Q3 2014 and is no longer recommended for use, as it does not support modern browsers. We strongly recommend using [RadHtmlChart](https://www.telerik.com/products/aspnet-ajax/html-chart.aspx), Telerik's modern client-side charting component. 
>To transition from RadChart to RadHtmlChart, refer to the following migration articles:
> - [Migrating Series]({%slug htmlchart/changes-and-backwards-compatibility/migrating-from-radchart-to-radhtmlchart/migrate-series-configuration%})
> - [Migrating Axes]({%slug htmlchart/changes-and-backwards-compatibility/migrating-from-radchart-to-radhtmlchart/migrate-axes-configuration%})

>Explore the [RadHtmlChart documentation]({%slug htmlchart/overview%}) and online demos to determine how it fits your development needs.

To provide flexibility and best ease-of-use, Telerik provides multiple avenues to populate RadChart. There are four main techniques for building the chart: interactively at design-time, declaratively in the ASP.NET HTML markup, programmatically at runtime and by data binding.

In simple scenarios or to test out a design you can use the design-time interface to build the entire chart. Collection editors provide a consistent interface and easy navigation over all your chart series and series items. You can also use the RadChart Wizard to display a subset of the data.

If your design style leans towards working with the ASP.NET HTML code directly you can declaratively define your chart series and chart series items.

Most business applications display some sort of database data so RadChart fully supports binding data sources to labels and data elements. RadChart also supports data binding to the X-Axis. In addition to database data, RadChart can bind to XML. RadChart binds to ObjectDataSource to support enterprise multi-tier scenarios. And of course you can bind your chart to arrays, collections, generic lists of simple types and lists of objects.

To create and populate the RadChart, [ChartSeries]({%slug chart/understanding-radchart-elements/series-overview%}) and [ChartSeriesItem]({%slug chart/understanding-radchart-elements/series-items%}) collections:

* At design time by [using the editors for ChartSeries and ChartSeriesItem collections]({%slug chart/building-radcharts/populate-radchart-at-design-time%}) or [using the RadChart Wizard]({%slug chart/understanding-radchart-ui/the-radchart-user-interface%}).

* [Declaratively in the ASP.NET HTML markup]({%slug chart/building-radcharts/creating-radchart-declaratively%}).

* [Binding to a datasource]({%slug chart/building-radcharts/data-binding-radchart%}) at run time or design time.

* Bind to a datasource programmatically to populate the ChartSeries and ChartSeriesItem collections. See this [minimal example of creating and populating a RadChart programmatically]({%slug chart/building-radcharts/creating-radchart-programmatically%}) or this [more complex example]({%slug chart/building-radcharts/creating-radchart-programmatically---more-complex-example%}).
