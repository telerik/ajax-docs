# Series-Specific Properties

>caution **RadChart** has been deprecated since Q3 2014 and is no longer recommended for use, as it does not support modern browsers. We strongly recommend using [RadHtmlChart](https://www.telerik.com/products/aspnet-ajax/html-chart.aspx), Telerik's modern client-side charting component. 
>To transition from RadChart to RadHtmlChart, refer to the following migration articles:
> - [Migrating Series]({%slug htmlchart/changes-and-backwards-compatibility/migrating-from-radchart-to-radhtmlchart/migrate-series-configuration%})
> - [Migrating Axes]({%slug htmlchart/changes-and-backwards-compatibility/migrating-from-radchart-to-radhtmlchart/migrate-axes-configuration%})
> - [Migrating Date Axes]({%slug htmlchart/changes-and-backwards-compatibility/migrating-from-radchart-to-radhtmlchart/migrate-date-axis-configuration%})
> - [Migrating Databinding]({%slug htmlchart/changes-and-backwards-compatibility/migrating-from-radchart-to-radhtmlchart/migrate-data-binding-configuration%})
> - [Features parity]({%slug htmlchart/changes-and-backwards-compatibility/migrating-from-radchart-to-radhtmlchart/migrate-functionalities---features-and-series-types-parity%})
>Explore the [RadHtmlChart documentation]({%slug htmlchart/overview%}) and online demos to determine how it fits your development needs.

The following are properties specific to the series appearance of specific [chart types]({%slug chart/understanding-radchart-types/radchart-types-overview%}).

## Bubble

The BubbleSize property is specific to the [Bubble]({%slug chart/understanding-radchart-types/bubble-charts%}) chart type and allows you to increase or decrease bubble size without distorting the shape.

## Lines and Splines

The LineSeriesAppearance property is specific to the [Line]({%slug chart/understanding-radchart-types/line-charts%}) and [Spline]({%slug chart/understanding-radchart-types/spline-charts%}) chart types.LineSeriesAppearance has a **Cap** property that governs the appearance of a line terminating shape that occurs where at each data point (except the first).Valid **Cap** values are **Flat**, **Square**, **Round**, **Triangle**, **NoAnchor**, **SquareAnchor**, **RoundAnchor**, **DiamondAnchor**, **ArrowAnchor**, **AnchorMask** and **Custom**. LineSeriesAppearance also has sub properties for **Color**, **PenStyle**, **Visible** and **Width**.

The PointMark is a shape that occurs at every data point, including the first.PointMarks are off by default but can be enabled using the Pointmark.Visible property. Use the Pointmark.Figure property to choose one of the predefined shapes. Other PointMark properties include **Border**, **Corners**, **Dimensions**, **FillStyle**, **RotationAngle** and **Shadow**.

The example above shows Series 1 in red where LineSeriesAppearance properties are:

* Border.Color = 50, 0, 245, 100

* Border.Width = 1

*  Figure  = Star5

* Visible = True

* Dimensions.Height = 25px

* FillStyle.FillType = Solid

* FillStyle.MainColor = 90, 100, 254, 100

* Shadow.Blur = 1

* Shadow.Color = DimGray

* Shadow.Distance = 2

## Pie

The StartAngle property specifies degrees for the rotation of a pie. The default value and the starting position is 0Â°. Positive values of the StartAngle property will rotate the pie clockwise and negative - counterclockwise.

The DiameterScale property controls the ratio between the size of the plot area and the diameter of the chart. It effectively sets the size of the pie. In the example below, DiameterScale is set to 1, .75 (the default) and .5.

The CenterXOffset and CenterYOffset properties specify the distance from the center of the plot area to the center of the pie in pixels. Use these two properties to position pie charts within the plot area.
