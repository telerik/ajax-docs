# Data Table

>caution **RadChart** has been deprecated since Q3 2014 and is no longer recommended for use, as it does not support modern browsers. We strongly recommend using [RadHtmlChart](https://www.telerik.com/products/aspnet-ajax/html-chart.aspx), Telerik's modern client-side charting component. 
>To transition from RadChart to RadHtmlChart, refer to the following migration articles:
> - [Migrating Series]({%slug htmlchart/changes-and-backwards-compatibility/migrating-from-radchart-to-radhtmlchart/migrate-series-configuration%})
> - [Migrating Axes]({%slug htmlchart/changes-and-backwards-compatibility/migrating-from-radchart-to-radhtmlchart/migrate-axes-configuration%})
> - [Migrating Date Axes]({%slug htmlchart/changes-and-backwards-compatibility/migrating-from-radchart-to-radhtmlchart/migrate-date-axis-configuration%})
> - [Migrating Databinding]({%slug htmlchart/changes-and-backwards-compatibility/migrating-from-radchart-to-radhtmlchart/migrate-data-binding-configuration%})
> - [Features parity]({%slug htmlchart/changes-and-backwards-compatibility/migrating-from-radchart-to-radhtmlchart/migrate-functionalities---features-and-series-types-parity%})
>Explore the [RadHtmlChart documentation]({%slug htmlchart/overview%}) and online demos to determine how it fits your development needs.

The PlotArea can display a table of the data in the chart.See the screen shot below. By default the DataTable Visible property is false. Use the *DataTable.Appearance* property to control the table layout including table size, cell size and cell position.
