# WebForms DataPager Overview



**RadDataPager** can be used to display paging navigation controls for other data-bound controls that implement the **IPageableItemContainer** or **IRadPageableItemContainer** interface (like the RadListView and MS ListView). 

##
The RadDataPager control lets users view large sets of data in small chunks for faster loading and easier navigation. It also provides a set of events, helper methods and properties for custom intervention.

You can easily add the RadDataPager control to a Web Form within Visual Studio. The paging interface appears wherever you place the RadDataPager control on the page. You may place it before or after the RadListView control, as well as within its LayoutTemplate element.

The RadDataPager control has the following properties for using it in its default state:

* **PagedControlID** is the ID of the control that implements one of the following interfaces - **IPageableItemContainer** or **IRadPageableItemContainer**. This is the control that will be paged by RadDataPager control. If RadDataPager is placed in Controls collection of IPageableItemContainer / IRadPageableItemContainer setting this property is optional. In case PagedControlID is not set, RadDataPager will attempt to find its container automatically.

* **PageSize** is the number of items and rows to display on each page.

* **StartRowIndex** gets the index of the first record that is displayed on a page of data.

* **TotalRowCount** gets the total number of records that are displayed in the underlying data source.

* **MaximumRows** gets the maximum number of records that are displayed for each page of data.

## RadDataPager field types

The RadDataPager control has a [number of fields]({%slug datapager/elements-and-templates/elements%}) you can use, including [template]({%slug datapager/elements-and-templates/template%}) support for designing your own pager. The following table lists the different RadDataPager fields:
