# RadPanelBar Items Overview



## The properties of panel items

The items of **RadPanelBar** have a few important properties, which are listed below:

* **Text** is the text of the item as it appears in the panel bar.

* **ToolTip** is the text of a tooltip that appears when the user hovers the mouse over the item.

>tip Setting the tooltip can enable an accessibility feature: Special accessibility readers like JAWS can pronounce the tooltip of the highlighted item.
>


* **Enabled** controls whether the item is enabled or disabled.

* **IsSeparator** specifies whether the panel item [acts as a separator]({%slug panelbar/appearance-and-styling/separators%}).
