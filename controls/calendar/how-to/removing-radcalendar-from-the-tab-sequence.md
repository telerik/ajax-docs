# Removing RadCalendar from the Tab Sequence



When browsing through a page with the Tab key, sometimes you want to skip the calendar from the controls gaining focus. Unfortunately setting its TabIndex=-1 will not accomplish this, as the tab index is not inherited by the child controls, which are html links (<*a href*> tags).

You can remove the calendar child controls from the tab sequence by writing a JavaScript function such as the following. Note that the function to set the tab index of child controls must be called both when the window loads, and by the client-side **OnCalendarViewChanged** event handler.

````JavaScript
<script type="text/javascript">
    if (window.attachEvent) {
        window.attachEvent("onload", ClearAnchors);
    }
    else {
       window.addEventListener("load", ClearAnchors, false);
    }
    function ClearAnchors() {
        var calendarTable = $get("<%= RadCalendar1.ClientID %>");
        var anchors = calendarTable.getElementsByTagName("a");
        for (var i = 0; i < anchors.length; i++) {
            var anchor = anchors[i];
            anchor.tabIndex = -1;
        }
    }
    function OnCalendarViewChanged(calendar, eventArgs) {
        ClearAnchors();
    }
</script>
````

If you are using **RadDatePicker** , **RadDateTimePicker** or **RadTimePicker**, a similar issue arises with the popup buttons, which are rendered as <*a*> tag. However, for these controls, the popup buttons are accessible through the **DatePopupButton** and **TimePopupButton** properties, so you can simply set the **TabIndex** property for the button in the designer.
