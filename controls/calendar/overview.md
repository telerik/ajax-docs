* __RadDatePicker__: A __RadDateInput__ control with an integrated __RadCalendar__ control to let users either enter the date and time value directly in the input area or select it from a popup calendar. The values of the two controls are synchronized to allow further change of the chosen date.

* __RadTimePicker__:____ A __RadDateInput__ control in time only mode with an integrated __RadTimeView__ control to let users enter a time directly in the input area or select it from the popup time view control.
