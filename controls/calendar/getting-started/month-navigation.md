# Month Navigation


The title bar of **RadCalendar** includes the controls for navigating to other views. By default, each view represents a single month. However, if the calendar is using[Multi-View mode]({%slug calendar/functionality/multi-view-mode%}), the view can include any number of months.

The title bar includes three types of controls for switching views:

* **Back X Views** / **Forward X Views** - The outermost controls, that appear as double arrow buttons ("<<" or ">>") move the current view by a fixed number of views, which is defined by the **FastNavigationStep** property. For example, in single view mode, if **FastNavigationStep** is 3, then clicking the ">>" button moves forward three months. In [multi-view mode]({%slug calendar/functionality/multi-view-mode%}), with two months showing, if **FastNavigationStep** is 3, then clicking the ">>" button moves forward six months.

* **Back 1 View** / **Forward 1 View** - The single arrow buttons ("<" or ">") move the view back or forward by a single view. In single view mode, clicking these buttons changes the view by a single month. In multi-view mode, clicking these buttons changes the view by the number of months shown in a single view.

* **Month and Year Selector** - Clicking on the title in the center of the title bar causes a popup to appear that lets the user navigate directly to a particular month or year. In the popup, the user can select month and year, then click the **OK** button to move to the view containing that month and year. Clicking the **Today** button moves to the view containing the current date. Clicking the **Cancel** button exits without changing the current view. The "<<" and ">>" buttons scroll through the possible years in the popup.
