# Localizing Strings


The **CultureInfo** property of the **RadCalendar** control determines the strings that will be used as month and day names. However, the **CultureInfo** property does not translate the other strings that appear in these controls.

On **RadCalendar** you may need to localize the strings that appear in the [month/year navigation]({%slug calendar/functionality/navigation-controls-settings%}). You can translate these strings using the **FastNavigationSettings** property:

````ASPNET
<telerik:RadCalendar
    ID="RadCalendar1"
    runat="server"
    CultureInfo="French (France)">
    <FastNavigationSettings
        CancelButtonCaption="Annuler"
        DateIsOutOfRangeMessage="La date est hors de gamme."
        OkButtonCaption="Accepter">
    </FastNavigationSettings>
</telerik:RadCalendar>
````


>note 
You can use the **FastNavigationSettings** property on the embedded popup calendar in a **RadDatePicker** or **RadDateTimePicker** control, as well as on a stand-alone **RadCalendar** control.
>


In addition, the tooltip strings that the various controls display may need to be localized. Most of the built-in tooltip strings are culture-neutral. For example, the built-in tooltip strings for the navigation controls on the **RadCalendar** title bar are simply pointers (e.g. ">") rather than text.
