# Smart Tag



The **Smart Tag** allows easy access to frequently needed tasks. You can display it by right clicking on a control in the design window, and choosing **Show Smart Tag** from its context menu.

## RadCalendar Smart Tag

The **RadCalendar** Smart Tag lets you perform the following:

## RadCalendar Tasks

* **SelectedDate** - lets you initialize the value of the **RadDatePicker**control to a date you select from a popup calendar.

* **MinDate** and **MaxDate** - specify the range of valid dates that the user can enter into the **RadDatePicker** control.

* **Enable Keyboard Navigation** - toggles support for Access Keys and navigation using the tab keys or arrow keys.

* **Enable Month-Year Fast Navigation** - enables or disables the month/year popup which appears when the user clicks the title area of the title bar. It allows the user to change the current view by selecting a specific month and year, or to move to the view that contains the current date.

* **Enable AutoPostBack** - lets you enable or disable postbacks when the user selects a date using the calendar control or changes the view using the navigation controls in the title bar. By default, the calendar does not do a postback when the user makes these changes.

* **Enable MultiSelect** - lets you specify whether the calendar can be used to select multiple dates or only a single date.

* **Highlight Today's date** - applies a special CSS class to highlight the cell which holds the present day.

* **Edit Special Days** - brings up the [RadCalendarDay Collection Editor]({%slug calendar/design-time/radcalendarday-collection-editor%}), where you can create a collection of "special" days that look and behave differently than other days in the calendar.

## Ajax Resources

* **Add RadAjaxManager** - adds a **RadAjaxManager** component to your Web page, and displays the **RadAjax Property Builder** where you can configure it.

* **Replace ScriptManager with RadScriptManager** - replaces the default **ScriptManager** component that is added for AJAX-enabled Web sites with **RadScriptManager**.

* **Add RadStyleSheetManager** - adds a **RadStyleSheetManager** to your Web page.

## Skin

The **Skin** drop-down lets you select from a list of available [Skins]({%slug calendar/appearance-and-styling/skins%}) to customize the look of your **RadCalendar** control.

## Learning Center

Links navigate you directly to **RadCalendar** examples, help, or Code Library. You can also search the Telerik web site for a given string.

## Edit Templates

The **Edit Templates** link brings up the [Template Design Surface]({%slug calendar/design-time/template-design-surface%}), where you can design templates for the calendar header and footer sections.
