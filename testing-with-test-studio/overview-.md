# Overview 



## 

Test Studio’s plugin for Visual Studio enables developers and testers comfortable writing code to work in the environment where they’re most productive. Telerik’s testing plugin features a robust built-in recorder that outputs functional tests in code, which you can directly customize or extend in Visual Studio. Build tests for advanced AJAX-powered applications – test dynamic pages, AJAX requests and operations, JavaScript calls and more.
