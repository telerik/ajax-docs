# Explore Control Features in UI for ASP.NET AJAX

Once you have the controls [working in your project]({%slug getting-started/first-steps%}), it's time to see what they can do. This article provides a short overview of how to get started with finding control functionality so you can use it.

## Demos

To get an overview of what each control offers, the fastest approach is to go to our [Live Demos](http://demos.telerik.com/aspnet-ajax).

You can **download the demo site** from your telerik.com account as a VS project and play around with the demos in the comfort of your IDE. The ` Telerik_UI_for_ASP.NET_AJAX_<version>_Demos_Dev.msi` and `Telerik_UI_for_ASP.NET_AJAX_<version>_Dev.zip` files contain the demo site. If your license is a trial one, you will see `...Trial.msi` and `...Trial.zip` respectively.

## Explore properties and tags

You can **explore** the available properties, events and inner tags of any control through the VS **intellisense** to get a quick glimpse of their concepts and availability.

## Documentation

In addition to that, the **documentation** provides a section for each control that contains help articles **on distinct features and API reference**.

## Design-time

Last, but not least, some most common tasks and configuration options are available in the control's **Smart Tag in Design Mode**. You will also find **design-time wizards** and **links** that can be useful when you are getting started with a feature, or even for advanced users who want to save time with setting up collections, data sources or properties.
