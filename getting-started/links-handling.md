## Web Resources

If you are using an ASP.NET server control with rich client-side behavior, it is likely built to utilize web resources. Sometimes your page loads and the rich server-side control does not work at all, for example, the tree view does not expand, the grid cannot sort, and so on. Most of the times such issues occur because the JavaScript files of those controls have failed to load.

If your browser is configured to prompt on JavaScript errors, you may see an error message similar to the `RadTreeView is undefined` one.

If you are using Telerik UI for ASP.NET AJAX, receiving this message indicates that there might be a Web Resource related issue.

## Identifying the Error

To identify the error that occurs, use either of the following approaches:

* Manually request the WebResource handler.

  View the rendered output of your page and get the URL of the offending script tag, for example:

  ````HTML
  <script type="text/javascript"
  src="/Sample/WebResource.axd?d=axd__
  axd&t=633437882200000000"></script>
  ````

  If you paste that URL in the address bar of your browser, specifically after the domain and folder, the web server will serve back the content of that web resource. If the issue is related to the HTTP handler of the web resource, you will see an error page saying that the server returned an HTTP error code 404 (not found) or 500 (server error).

* Using web development tools to request the WebResource handler.

  Use an HTTP traffic sniffer tool like [Google DevTools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/resources), [Fiddler](https://www.telerik.com/fiddler), or [Firefox FireBug](http://www.getfirebug.com/) to find out if the request to a web resource file has failed and what the exact error is.
