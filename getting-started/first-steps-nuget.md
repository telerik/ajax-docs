# First Steps by Installing from a NuGet Package

[NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/) is a popular .NET package manager. Progress maintains the Telerik NuGet Feed for registered users and you can include the Telerik UI for ASP.NET AJAX suite in your project as well as update to the latest available version from there. Installing the Telerik UI for ASP.NET AJAX library with NuGet works both for Windows and MacOS machines.

>The [legacy Telerik NuGet server](https://nuget.telerik.com/nuget) is now deprecated. Make sure to switch to the [new Telerik NuGet server](https://nuget.telerik.com/v3/index.json), which is faster, lighter, and reduces the number of requests from your NuGet client.

This tutorial describes how to get up and running with the Telerik UI for ASP.NET AJAX library by downloading and installing the controls with NuGet.

* First, you will add the Telerik NuGet feed to Visual Studio and install the Telerik UI for ASP.NET AJAX library.
* Next, you'll create your ASP.NET AJAX application and add the Editor control to it.
* Then, you will dive deeper by defining the HtmlChart control and binding it to sample data.
* Finally, you will add some styling to the controls.

## Prerequisites

1. [Install Visual Studio 2019 or later](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/).

1. [Install .NET Framework 4.5 or later](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download).

1. [Install the ASP.NET Web Forms application](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/web-forms/) on your development or production machine. ASP.NET Web Forms is available in the .NET 4.0-4.8 installations.

1. If a new user, [create a Telerik account](https://www.telerik.com/account/).

## Step 1: Add the Telerik NuGet Feed to Visual Studio

## Step 2: Install Telerik UI for ASP.NET AJAX

Now that you have successfully added the Telerik NuGet feed as a package source, you need to authenticate your local NuGet instance, display the available packages, and install Telerik UI for ASP.NET AJAX:

1. Create a new WebForms project or open an existing one.

1. Go to **Tools** > **NuGet Package Manager** > **Manage NuGet Packages for Solution...**.

1. Select the Telerik NuGet **Package source** from the drop-down list on the left.

1. Select the **Browse** tab to see the available packages. In older Visual Studio versions, this tab is called **Online**.

1. Select the desired Telerik UI for ASP.NET AJAX package and click **Install**. To select the correct package version for your project, the .NET version of your project must correspond to the `.Net<version>` portion of the package name. For example, the correct package for `.NET Framework 4` projects is `Telerik.UI.for.AspNet.Ajax.Net40`.

## Step 6: Style the Controls

Telerik UI for ASP.NET AJAX provides more than [20 predefined skins]({% slug introduction/radcontrols-for-asp.net-ajax-fundamentals/controlling-visual-appearance/how-to-load-skins-from-external-assemblies %}) that allow you to change the look and feel of each component. To use the desired skin, set the skin name as the `Skin` property value of the control:

```ASPX
<telerik:RadEditor runat="server" ID="RadEditor2" Skin="Glow" RenderMode="Lightweight">
    <Content>             
        Congratulations! You have the Telerik UI for ASP.NET controls running in your project!     
    </Content>
</telerik:RadEditor>
```
