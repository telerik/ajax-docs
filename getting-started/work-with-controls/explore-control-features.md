# Exploring the Controls and their Features

This article describes how to use the learning resources that will help you find information about the Telerik controls, their functionalities, and features.

## Demos

To see a Telerik control in action and get an overview of its most popular features, go to the [Live Demos](https://demos.telerik.com/aspnet-ajax).

You can download an MSI installer with these demos from your [Telerik account](https://www.telerik.com/account/product-download?product=RCAJAX) and then explore them in the comfort of your IDE. The `Telerik_UI_for_ASP.NET_AJAX_<version>_Demos_Dev.msi` and `Telerik_UI_for_ASP.NET_AJAX_<version>_Demos_Trial.msi` files contain a Visual Studio solution with all demos.

## Documentation

For each control, the documentation provides a [dedicated main section]({%slug breadcrumb/overview%}) with various sub-sections:

* [Functionality]({%slug breadcrumb/functionality/items%})&mdash;Contains articles that explain how to use some of the main features and functionalities of the controls.

* [Server-side Programming]({%slug breadcrumb/server-side-programming/overview%})&mdash;Contains detailed information about the properties and events in the control's server-side API. This is the first place to look at when you need to implement additional server-side logic in the control.

* [Client-side Programming]({%slug breadcrumb/client-side-programming/overview%})&mdash;Contains information about the properties and events in the control's client-side API. This is the first place to look at when you need to implement additional client-side logic in the control.

* [How to]({%slug breadcrumb/how-to/how-to-integrate-radbreadcrumb-with-fontawesome-icons%})&mdash;Contains how-to instructions for custom scenarios.

You will also find rich [client-side](https://docs.telerik.com/devtools/aspnet-ajax/api/client/Telerik.Web.UI.GridColumn) and [server-side](https://docs.telerik.com/devtools/aspnet-ajax/api/server/Telerik.Web.UI/GridAnimationSettings) API references.

## Properties and Tags

Visual Studio's IntelliSense allows you to explore the available properties, events, and inner tags of any control.

## Smart Tags and Wizards at Design-Time

Most tasks and configuration options are available in the control's Smart Tag in Design Mode. You will also find design-time wizards and links that can be useful if you are getting started with a feature or even if you are an advanced user who wants to save time with setting up collections, data sources, or properties.
