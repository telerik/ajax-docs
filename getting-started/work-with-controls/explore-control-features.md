# Exploring the Controls and Their Features

This article lists the available learning resources and hints on their usage to help you find the information you need about the Telerik UI for ASP.NET AJAX controls, functionality, and features.

## Demos

To see a control in action and get an overview of its most popular features, refer to the [Live Demos](https://demos.telerik.com/aspnet-ajax) page.

You can also download these demos together with the MSI installer from your [Telerik account](https://www.telerik.com/account/product-download?product=RCAJAX) and explore them in the comfort of your IDE. The `Telerik_UI_for_ASP.NET_AJAX_<version>_Demos_Dev.msi` and `Telerik_UI_for_ASP.NET_AJAX_<version>_Demos_Trial.msi` files contain a Visual Studio solution with all demos.

## Documentation

For each control, the Telerik UI for ASP.NET AJAX product documentation provides a [dedicated main section]({%slug breadcrumb/overview%}) with sub-sections. For example, the Breadcrumb control:

* [Functionality]({%slug breadcrumb/functionality/items%})&mdash;Contains articles about using some of the main features and functionalities of the control.

* [Server-side programming]({%slug breadcrumb/server-side-programming/overview%})&mdash;Contains detailed information about the properties and events in the control server-side API. Useful for implementing additional server-side logic in the control.

* [Client-side programming]({%slug breadcrumb/client-side-programming/overview%})&mdash;Contains information about the properties and events in the control client-side API. Useful for implementing additional client-side logic in the control.

For useful scenarios and troubleshooting issues, run a search through the [Knowledge Base section](https://docs.telerik.com/devtools/aspnet-ajax/knowledge-base).

For specific control settings, refer to the [client-side](https://docs.telerik.com/devtools/aspnet-ajax/api/client/Telerik.Web.UI.GridColumn) and [server-side](https://docs.telerik.com/devtools/aspnet-ajax/api/server/Telerik.Web.UI/GridAnimationSettings) API references&mdash;in this case, the Grid as an example.

## Smart Tags and Wizards at Design-Time

Most tasks and configuration options are available in the **Smart Tag** of the control in Design mode. You will also find design-time wizards and links that can be useful if you are getting started with a feature or even if you are an advanced user who wants to save time with setting up collections, data sources, or properties.
