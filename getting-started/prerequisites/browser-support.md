# Introduction

Telerik is a pioneer in offering cross-browser compatible components for ASP.NET. This has been, is and will remain a top priority for the company. If adding new features is difficult, just think about doing so while maintaining cross-browser compatibility. This requires careful design work, extensive testing and very deep understanding of the intricacies of all platforms (browsers).

## Table of supported Browsers

The following tables list the browsers the UI for ASP.NET AJAX suite supports:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th align="left">BROWSER</th>
      <th align="left">SUPPORTED VERSIONS</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td align="left">Edge</td>
      <td align="left">The two latest versions at the time of the release.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td align="left">Chrome</td>
      <td align="left">The two latest versions at the time of the release.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
