## Tips and Tricks

By default, each Telerik control serves a set of files (JavaScript code and stylesheets) that are needed for proper client-side operation and rendering.

When loading a page with several controls on it, the number of these files can become very large, often resulting in a reduced page load time and increased traffic. The reason for this problem is that browsers make separate requests to the server for each of these resources.

Usually, this problem is overcome by disabling the automatic script and stylesheet serving the controls, combining them into a smaller set of files and manually registering the links to these files in the page.

This approach is not the best for a number of reasons:

* You must extract the files from the assembly for each control release.

* Files become too large to be maintainable or you have to write a script to merge the source files.

* The number of the merged files you need to maintain can become very large depending on the control sets you have on different pages.

Nevertheless, by using the [ScriptManager]({%slug scriptmanager/overview%}) and the [StyleSheetManager]({%slug stylesheetmanager/overview%}) controls, you can use dragging and dropping to achieve the combination of resources to a single request. You need to add a [ScriptManager]({%slug scriptmanager/overview%}) to your page instead of the default ScriptManager and the JavaScript files will get combined into a single file. Additionally, including the [StyleSheetManager]({%slug stylesheetmanager/overview%}) in the page makes the stylesheet requests combined into a single request. Both controls need an HttpHandler to be declared in the application configuration file to operate properly. To add the handler, use the **Smart Tags** of the controls.

The ScriptManager and the StyleSheetManager controls also enable you to download the resources the Telerik controls need from the Telerik CDN instead of using WebResource requests. To do that, set their `CdnSettings-TelerikCdn` property to `Enabled`. For more information, refer to the [CDN Overview]({%slug scriptmanager/cdn-support/overview%}) article. Using the CDN takes load off your server and improves resource caching.

Downloading from the CDN, however, will result in a request for each individual file (script, stylesheet, font, and so on). You can improve the CDN performance even further by instructing the controls to fetch a combined resource of all scripts and base stylesheets for all the controls in a single request by toggling the `Telerik.ScriptManager.TelerikCdn.CombinedResource` and `Telerik.StyleSheetManager.TelerikCdn.CombinedResource` [`appSettings` keys]({% slug general-information/web-config-settings-overview %}) to `enabled`. This configuration is exposed for an individual instance through the `CdnSettings-CombinedResource` property.

The following table lists Telerik UI for ASP.NET AJAX controls and the resources for their performance optimization.

|Inputs and TextBoxes|Performance problems can be caused by using inputs and textboxes in templates of list controls. A better idea is to create an outside edit form similar to the one demonstrated in the [Client-side edit, update, delete and insert with Controls for ASP.NET AJAX, WebServices and LINQ](https://www.telerik.com/blogs/client-side-edit-update-delete-and-insert-with-radcontrols-for-asp-net-ajax-webservices-and-linq) article.
