# Change Control Appearance

The UI for ASP.NET AJAX controls use [Skins]({%slug introduction/radcontrols-for-asp.net-ajax-fundamentals/controlling-visual-appearance/how-skins-work%}) to change their appearance. We provide over 20 built-in skins that can fit in the majority of web application designs.

The easiest way to [set a skin]({%slug introduction/radcontrols-for-asp.net-ajax-fundamentals/controlling-visual-appearance/overview%}#using-a-skin) is to use the **Design-time Skin dropdown in the Smart Tag** of the control. You can show the Smart Tag in Source Mode by pressing `Ctrl+.`.

## Custom Appearance

In case you need to tweak the control appearance to something that is not provided out-of-the-box by a built-in skin, there are two distinct approaches:

* You can [create a few CSS overrides]({%slug introduction/radcontrols-for-asp.net-ajax-fundamentals/controlling-visual-appearance/modifying-built-in-skins%}) that will implement the small change you seek.

* Or, you can [create a custom skin]({%slug theme-builder/create%}) that matches your requirements.

In either case, you may find helpful the [Improve Your Debugging Skills with Chrome DevTools](https://www.telerik.com/blogs/improve-your-debugging-skills-with-chrome-devtools) blog post.

If you experience issues with the control appearance, start by examining the [Different appearance or behavior in Internet Explorer on local and production servers](https://www.telerik.com/support/kb/aspnet-ajax/details/different-appearance-in-internet-explorer-on-local-and-production-servers) KB article.
