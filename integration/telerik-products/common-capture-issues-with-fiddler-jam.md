## Capture network logs & log issues with Fiddler Jam in ASP.NET Web Forms

[Fiddler Jam](https://www.telerik.com/fiddler-jam)'s browser extension is Telerik's new remote troubleshooting solution to facilitate the information exchange between the support and end-user. A simple capture log from the end-user can provide a lot of information to the support team:
- Console logs and errors
- Network requests
- Local and Session Storage logs
- Video recording and screenshots
- User action events

You can [install the extension](https://docs.telerik.com/fiddler-jam/fj-extension/get-started-extension) from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fiddler-jam/fnkjlegmkbicdodlheligomlfbdblpfj) or the [Microsoft Edge Store](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/fiddler-jam/fpolpgbhhhbioobffnkcfhmdafkgcmbh).


## Capture a Log

The [Predefined link](https://docs.telerik.com/fiddler-jam/fj-extension/predefined-link) functionality allows easy capture and pre-configured setup just by clicking the link below. It will provide detailed instructions to follow on the fly.

Once you are ready with the log, you can preview it (click the `Preview` button once the capturing is stopped), configure the [Log Sharing Options](https://docs.telerik.com/fiddler-jam/fj-extension/link-options) and share it.
