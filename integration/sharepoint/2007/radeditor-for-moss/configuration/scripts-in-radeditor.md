# Scripts in RadEditor

Please review bellow how to enable the use of Scriptswhen using RadEditor for MOSS:

* **In WebPart scenario**Set (add if not present) the **AllowScripts** property to **true** in [ConfigFile.xml]({%slug sharepoint/2007/radeditor-for-moss/configuration/set-properties-via-config-file%})

* **In WCM scenario**This feature is available only if you have replaced the original editor through SharePoint Designer. If you are using 5.5.1 or newer version of RadEditor for MOSS, set the he **AllowScripts** and **AllowSpecialTags** properties to **true** in the current page using SharePoint Designer, otherwise set (add if not present) the **AllowScripts**property to true in [ConfigFile.xml]({%slug sharepoint/2007/radeditor-for-moss/configuration/set-properties-via-config-file%}) and **AllowSpecialTags** in the the current page using SharePoint Designer.

* **In SharePoint forms scenario (Lists, Wikis, Blogs, etc.)**You cannot use JavaScript in RadEditor in such scenario. There RadEditor does not have control over the presentation view which means that we cannot control the output when it is not in edit mode.
