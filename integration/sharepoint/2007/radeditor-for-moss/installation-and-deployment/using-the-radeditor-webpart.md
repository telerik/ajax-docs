# Using the RadEditor WebPart





RadEditor for MOSS comes with a special Web Part, which you can use as a cross-browser alternative to the default rich-text editor Web Part. Please, note that the deployment process will not automatically replace existing Web Parts with the new RadEditor Web Part. Since there is no supported way of performing this replacement you should [migrate your existing rich-text editor Web Parts]({%slug sharepoint/2007/radeditor-for-moss/migration-and-upgrade/migrating-default-rich-text-editor-web-parts%}) manually.
