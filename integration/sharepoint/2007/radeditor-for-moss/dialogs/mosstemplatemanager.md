# MOSSTemplateManager

By using the **MOSSTemplateManager**tool the users can add items from the **Reusable Content** list to the content of **RadEditor for MOSS**. When the user clicks the MOSSTemplateManager toolbar button the standard **Select Reusable Content Web Page** dialog box opens and displays the contents of the **Reusable Content**list. Here the user can browse the list for the item that he wants to add.

## Usage in different scenarios:

* Web Content Management scenario – This is the case when the user uses **RadEditor for MOSS** to edit content that is contained by a Page Content field control. Here the user can benefit from the full functionality of **MOSS Reusable Content** and most important the **Automatic Update** feature.

* WebPart and List Items – Since the Reusable Content functionality is not available in the out of the box Html Editor in such scenarios, the **MOSSTemplateManager** tool of **RadEditor for MOSS** can only be used as a plain HTML template manager. Here the **Automatic Update** feature is not available.



## Browser compatibility issues:

The **MOSSTemplateManager** toolbar button opens the standard Select Reusable Content Web Page dialog. This dialog however is not compatible with FireFox.
