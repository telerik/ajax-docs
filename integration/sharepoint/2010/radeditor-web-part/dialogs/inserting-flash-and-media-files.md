# Inserting Flash and Media Files

**Web Part and WCM scenario**

You need to modify the **ToolsFile.xml** which is located in the following folder:

_/Program Files/Common Files/Microsoft Shared/web server extensions/wpresources/RadEditorSharePoint/6.x.x.0__1f131a624888eeed/Resources/_

and add the following tools:

`<tool name="FlashManager" /><tool name="MediaManager" />`

>caution in the WCM scenario you will also need to add / set the **AllowSpecialTags** property to true. You can set it in the current page using SharePoint Designer. [Click here]({%slug sharepoint/2007/radeditor-for-moss/configuration/setting-configfile-and-toolsfile-properties-for-the-wcm-field%}) for more information

**SharePoint forms scenario (Lists, Blogs, etc.)**

You cannot enter Media / Flash files in such scenarios. There RadEditor does not have control over the presentation view which means that we cannot control the output when it is not in edit mode.
