# Upgrading RadEditor WebPart Version

This article explains how to upgrade to a newer version of RadEditor for SharePoint 2010. In the instructions below we will upgrade from v6.0.0.0 to v6.1.0.0.

In SharePoint 2010 deployments use the following steps to upgrade an existing version of Telerik controls for Sharepoint 2010 to a newer version of Telerik controls for Sharepoint 2010:

1. Make sure that you write the current version of RadEditorSharePoint assembly. It is needed in case you want to access previously created with RadEditor for SP2010 WebParts. There are three ways of getting the version of the assembly:

1. Check the version of the assembly in the GAC.

1. Check the first four digits of the **x.x.x.x__1f131a624888eeed** folder in **Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Web Server Extensions\wpresources\RadEditorSharePoint**.

1. Check the **web.config**file of your SharePoint 2010 site for a **SafeControl** element such as `<SafeControl Assembly="RadEditorSharePoint, Version=x.x.x.x, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=1f131a624888eeed" Namespace="Telerik.SharePoint" TypeName="*" Safe="True" SafeAgainstScript="False" />`

1. Uninstall the old version of Telerik controls For Sharepoint 2010 as described [here]({%slug sharepoint/2010/radeditor-web-part/installation-and-deployment/uninstalling%}).

1. Install the new version of Telerik controls For Sharepoint 2010 as described [here]({%slug sharepoint/2010/installation-and-deployment/installing-telerik-web-parts-for-sharepoint%}).

1. Paste the following `<dependentAssembly>` element in the `<assemblyBinding>` tag in the web.config file:

	**XML**
    
		<runtime>
			...
			   <assemblyBinding xmlns="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v1">
			     <dependentAssembly>
			       <assemblyIdentity name="RadEditorSharePoint" publicKeyToken="1f131a624888eeed" culture="neutral" />
			       <bindingRedirect oldVersion="1.0.0.0-<old version>" newVersion="<new version>" />
			     </dependentAssembly>
			...
			   </assemblyBinding>
			...
		</runtime>
	    
    The `<old version>` here represents the old product version (**6.0.0.0**), while `<new version>` should be replaced     with the current version (**6.1.0.0** in this example):

	**XML**
    
		<dependentAssembly>
			<assemblyIdentity name="RadEditorSharePoint" publicKeyToken="1f131a624888eeed" culture="neutral" />
			<bindingRedirect oldVersion="1.0.0.0-6.0.0.0" newVersion="6.1.0.0" />
		</dependentAssembly>

1. (Web Parts) To enable the RadEditor Web Parts, which were created with the previous version, open the web.config file of your SharePoint site and add the following line right above the `</SafeControls>` tag:

	**XML**
    
        <SafeControl Assembly="RadEditorSharePoint, Version=<old version>, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=1f131a624888eeed"
	    	Namespace="Telerik.SharePoint" Typename="*" Safe="True" />

    In this case `<old version>` is **6.0.0.0**, so the `<SafeControl>` tag should look like this:

	**XML**
    
        <SafeControl Assembly="RadEditorSharePoint, Version=6.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=1f131a624888eeed"
        	Namespace="Telerik.SharePoint" Typename="*" Safe="True" />
        	
    >tip If you have upgraded multiple times, it is suggested to keep all **SafeControl** registrations for each version used.
