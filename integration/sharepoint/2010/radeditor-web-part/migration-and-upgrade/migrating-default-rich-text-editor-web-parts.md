# Migrating Default Rich-text Editor Web Parts


 

In existing SharePoint 2010 applications you need to manually migrate the content of the default rich-text editor Web Part to Telerik RadEditor Web Part. Unfortunately, there is no supported way of doing that automatically.

For each page where you have a rich-text editor Web Part you have to perform the following:

1. Open the page for editing

1. Copy the content of a given rich-text editor Web Part

1. Delete this rich-text editor Web Part

1. Place a RadEditor Web Part on its place (as described in [Using the RadEditor WebPart]({%slug sharepoint/2010/radeditor-web-part/installation-and-deployment/getting-started%}))

1. Paste to copied content inside the RadEditor Web Part and save it

1. Repeat steps 2-5 for all rich-text editor Web Parts on the page
