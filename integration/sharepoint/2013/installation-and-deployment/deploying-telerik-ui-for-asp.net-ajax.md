# Deploying Telerik® UI for ASP.NET AJAX




To leverage Telerik® UI for ASP.NET AJAX on a SharePoint Server 2013, their assemblies need to be deployed on that server.Once the required files are deployed, our ASP.NET AJAX controls can be added to the site by editing the site’s page or web part, in which the controls will be added.

When the **SharePoint 2013 Web Parts** are installed on the SharePoint server via the automatic installer, the Telerik controls will be deployed on the SharePoint server without the need to manually install files in the GAC and modify the web.config of the application.

It is also possible to deploy the Telerik controls without the automatic installer. This section outlines the required steps that need to be taken in this case prior to implementing the controls within an existing SharePoint web site:

1. First you need to install **Telerik.Web.UI.dll**, **Telerik.Web.Design.dll** and **Telerik.Web.UI.Skins.dll** in the GAC (Global Assembly Cache) of your SharePoint server. This can be done by opening the Developer Command Prompt for Visual Studio (**Start > All Programs > Microsoft Visual Studio [VS version] > Visual Studio Tools**) and running the following command for each of the mentioned assemblies: **gacutil -i [path to assembly]** More information about using the **gacutil** tool for adding the assemblies of Telerik controls in GAC can be found in [Using the Global Assembly Cache]({%slug introduction/deployment/using-the-global-assembly-cache%}) article. After running the gacutil command, the assemblies can be examined in the folder **`%windir%\Microsoft.NET\assembly\GAC_MSIL`**, which is the location of the Global Assembly Cache for .NET 4.0 and above.

1. Next you should tell SharePoint that the Telerik controls are safe to use. To do so you should add a few **`<SafeControl>`** entries within the **`<SafeControls>`** section in your web.config:
	````XML
		<SafeControl Assembly="Telerik.Web.UI, Version=x.x.x.x, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=121fae78165ba3d4"
		    Namespace="Telerik.Web.UI" TypeName="*" Safe="True" />
		<SafeControl Assembly="Telerik.Web.Design, Version=x.x.x.x, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=121fae78165ba3d4"
		    Namespace="Telerik.Web.Design" TypeName="*" Safe="True" />
		<SafeControl Assembly="Telerik.Web.UI.Skins, Version=x.x.x.x, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=121fae78165ba3d4"
		    Namespace="Telerik.Web.UI.Skins" TypeName="*" Safe="True" />
````

1. Some of the Telerik controls require the HTTP handler **Telerik.Web.UI.WebResource.axd** so it is recommended to register it in web.config as shown below:
	````XML
		<system.webServer>
		  <handlers>
		    <add name="Telerik.Web.UI.WebResource.axd_*" path="Telerik.Web.UI.WebResource.axd" verb="*" type="Telerik.Web.UI.WebResource, Telerik.Web.UI, Version=x.x.x.x, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=121fae78165ba3d4" preCondition="integratedMode" />
		  </handlers>
		</system.webServer>
````

>caution The value of **Version** in all settings above should match the version of Telerik® UI for ASP.NET AJAX that is currently installed in the GAC.	If there are **`<SafeControl>`** settings and HTTP handler registrations that refer to another version, it is recommended to remove them, because they could cause errors in the SharePoint site.
