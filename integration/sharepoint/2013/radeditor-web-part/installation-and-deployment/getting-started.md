# Getting Started





RadEditor for SharePoint 2013 comes with a special Web Part, which you can use as a cross-browser alternative to the default rich-text editor Web Part. Please, note that the deployment process will not automatically replace existing Web Parts with the new RadEditor Web Part. Since there is no supported way of performing this replacement you should migrate your existing rich-text editor Web Parts manually.

Follow the steps below to add a new RadEditor Web Part to a given page.

1. Open your Web Application and browse to a Web Part page.

1. Click the Edit Page button or select Edit Page from the Site Actions menu.
