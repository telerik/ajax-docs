# Telerik Web Parts for SharePoint 2016

This article explains how to use the Telerik web parts for SharePoint 2016.

SharePoint 2016 offers similar app model and server infrastructure to SharePoint 2013 in terms of web part registration and usage. This means that you can **[install manually]({%slug sharepoint/2013/installation-and-deployment/installing-telerik-web-parts%}#manual-installation-upgrade-and-removal) and use the SharePoint 2013 Telerik web parts under SharePoint 2016** until an official `msi` installation package is provided by Telerik.

The SharePoint 2013 documentation applies to SharePoint 2016 and you can use it as a reference guide to see how to [install the web parts manually]({%slug sharepoint/2013/installation-and-deployment/installing-telerik-web-parts%}#manual-installation-upgrade-and-removal), [deploy]({%slug sharepoint/2013/installation-and-deployment/deploying-telerik-ui-for-asp.net-ajax%}) and configure the [provided web parts]({%slug sharepoint/2013/radeditor-web-part/overview%}) or [create your own]({%slug sharepoint/2013/installation-and-deployment/create-an-ajax-enabled-sharepoint-webpart-with-telerik-controls%}). The [Troubleshooting]({%slug sharepoint/troubleshooting/known-issues%}) section also applies.
