## Description

When scrolling is enabled, the scroll area of the grid has a fixed scroll height of 300px. This causes a blank space to appear if theÂ item  count is too low.

## Solution
  
If you want the grid to have its height automatically adjusted to its records, you can set an empty value to the following property:  

````
<Scrolling ScrollHeight="" />
````

Alternatively, if you want to set a percentage height to the grid, you can follow the steps provided here:
