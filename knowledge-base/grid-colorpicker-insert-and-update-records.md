 **HOW TO**  

This article shows how to bind a **RadGridTemplateColumn **that contains a **RadColorPicker **to a *SqlDataSource*. The code for inserting a new record to
the DataBase and updating an existing record are shown in the attached projects.  
   
 **DESCRIPTION**  

The MSSQL server does not have a type that corresponds to the *System.Drawing.Color* type in .NET. The **RadColorPicker** control works with that .NET type, however.

 **  

SOLUTION**  

In the attached sample a column of type *nvarchar*is used to store the value of the color (an example value is: *#66CC99*) in the SQL server. TheÂ *FromHtml*and *ToHtml* static methods of the [System.Drawing.ColorTranslator](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.drawing.colortranslator.aspx) class are used in order to parse a string to an object of type *System.Drawing.Color* and vice-versa. The zip files bellow contain the full source code of the implementation in VB.NET and C# including
the database file used in the sample.
