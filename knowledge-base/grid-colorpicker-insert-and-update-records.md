## HOW-TO

This article shows how to bind a **RadGridTemplateColumn **that contains a **RadColorPicker **to a *SqlDataSource*. The code for inserting a new record to
the DataBase and updating an existing record are shown in the attached projects.  
   
 ## DESCRIPTION

The MSSQL server does not have a type corresponding to the *System.Drawing.Color* type in .NET. The **RadColorPicker** control works with that .NET type, however.   

## SOLUTION

In the attached sample a column of type *nvarchar* is used to store the value of the color (an example value is: *#66CC99*) in the SQL server. TheÂ *FromHtml*and *ToHtml* static methods of the [System.Drawing.ColorTranslator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.drawing.colortranslator?view=net-8.0&redirectedfrom=MSDN) class are used to parse a string to an object of type *System.Drawing.Color* and vice-versa. The zip files below contain the full source code of the implementation in VB.NET and C# including
the database file used in the sample.
