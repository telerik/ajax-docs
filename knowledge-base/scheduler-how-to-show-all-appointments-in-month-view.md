## HOW TO 
   
 Show all appointments in Month View of RadScheduler
   
## DESCRIPTION  
   
Each row should expand to accommodate all appointments in the given week. Weeks that don't contain appointments should not take extra space.
   
## SOLUTION   
   
 Set the MonthView-VisibleAppointmentsPerDay property to the maximum number of appointments that you want to show. Then setÂ MonthView-AdaptiveRowHeight to "true" to allow independent row height:  
   
````ASPX
<telerik:RadScheduler ... >
    <MonthView VisibleAppointmentsPerDay="30" AdaptiveRowHeight="true" />
</telerik:RadScheduler>
````
