## Environment

## Description

When viewing a web page on Safari (iPad, iPhone), `RadTextBox` controls placed inside a [RadPanelBar](https://docs.telerik.com/devtools/aspnet-ajax/controls/panelbar/overview) do not respond to touch events â€” specifically, the keyboard does not appear. However, the text boxes work as expected when placed outside the RadPanelBar.

## Cause

The issue stems from the way touch interactions are managed within Telerik controls, particularly how the touch scroll extender in the RadPanelBar interferes with touch events on iOS devices.

## Solution

Disable the touch scroll extender for the RadPanelBar when the page loads. This action allows the `RadTextBox` controls within the RadPanelBar to respond normally to touch events on iOS devices. Use the following JavaScript snippet in your page:

```javascript
<script>
function OnClientLoad(sender, args) {
    if (Telerik.Web.Browser.safari && Telerik.Web.Platform.ios && sender._touchScrollExtender) {
        sender._touchScrollExtender.disable();
    }
}
</script>
```

And add the `OnClientLoad` event to your `RadPanelBar` control:

```aspnet
<telerik:RadPanelBar ID="FindRadPanelBar" runat="server" OnClientLoad="OnClientLoad" ExpandMode="SingleExpandedItem" Width="100%">
    <!-- PanelBar content here -->
</telerik:RadPanelBar>
```

This solution specifically targets iOS devices to ensure that `RadTextBox` controls within the `RadPanelBar` become responsive to touch events, making them usable on devices like iPads.
