## Description

**[Critical Security Bulletin] – [July 2026]** – [CVE-2026-13181](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-13181), [CVE-2026-13182](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-13182), [CVE-2026-13183](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-13183), [CVE-2026-13184](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-13184), [CVE-2026-13185](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-13185), [CVE-2026-13186](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-13186), [CVE-2026-13190](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-13190)

- Progress® Telerik® UI for AJAX 2026 Q2 (2026.2.519) or earlier.

Multiple high security vulnerabilities have been confirmed in Telerik UI for ASP.NET AJAX affecting the RadAsyncUpload, RadPersistenceManager, and RadDockLayout components. When chained together, these vulnerabilities can allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server hosting the application. This article describes the combined attack chain, its impact, and the actions required to remediate or mitigate the risk.

### What Are the Symptoms?

There are no visible symptoms. These vulnerabilities can be exploited silently without causing application errors visible to the application owner. Successful exploitation leaves no obvious trace in standard ASP.NET error logs.

### What Are the Impacts?

An unauthenticated remote attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability chain can execute arbitrary code on the web server with the privileges of the application pool identity. This may result in full server compromise, data exfiltration, or further lateral movement within the hosting environment.

### Affects

| Component | Affected Version | Fixed Version |
|---|---|---|
| RadAsyncUpload | `>= 2010.1.309` && `<= 2026.2.519` | `>= 2026.2.708` (2026 Q2 SP1) |
| RadPersistenceManager | `>= 2013.1.220` && `<= 2026.2.519` | `>= 2026.2.708` (2026 Q2 SP1) |
| RadDockLayout | `>= 2013.1.220` && `<= 2026.2.519` | `>= 2026.2.708` (2026 Q2 SP1) |

> Our only official recommendation is to upgrade to the patched release following the [Upgrade to a Newer Version](https://www.telerik.com/products/aspnet-ajax/documentation/upgrade-compatibility/upgrading-instructions/upgrading-a-trial-to-a-developer-license-or-to-a-newer-version) documentation. If you cannot upgrade immediately, visit the [Mitigation](#mitigation) section for temporary mitigation options.

If you have any questions or concerns related to this issue, please [log in to open a new Technical Support case](https://prgress.co/DevToolsSupport). If your version is no longer supported as part of the [Telerik UI for ASP.NET AJAX Release History](https://www.telerik.com/support/whats-new/aspnet-ajax/release-history), you should upgrade to a supported and fixed version.

## Issue

- CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength
- CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data
- CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname ('Path Traversal')

In Progress Telerik UI for ASP.NET AJAX before version 2026.2.708 (2026 Q2 SP1), multiple vulnerabilities in RadAsyncUpload, RadPersistenceManager, and RadDockLayout can be combined by an unauthenticated remote attacker to achieve Remote Code Execution on the server. 

## Solution

We have addressed the vulnerabilities and the Progress Telerik team strongly recommends performing an upgrade to the latest version listed in the table above.

For all customers on a current maintenance agreement, the upgrade can be accessed by logging into the [Product Downloads | Your Account](https://www.telerik.com/account/downloads/product-download?product=RCAJAX). Customers that are not on a current maintenance agreement should [contact a Progress account representative](https://www.telerik.com/account).

To confirm your current version of Telerik UI for ASP.NET AJAX, open your project in Visual Studio and check the version of Telerik.Web.UI.dll in the References, or see [How to determine which version of Telerik UI for ASP.NET AJAX you are using](https://docs.telerik.com/devtools/aspnet-ajax/knowledge-base/common-assembly-version).

## Mitigation

If you cannot upgrade immediately, apply all applicable mitigations from the checklist below.

| # | Check | Applies to |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `customErrors` is `RemoteOnly` or `On` in Web.config | All apps with RadAsyncUpload |
| 2 | Carefully review *any* use of `Telerik.AsyncUpload.ConfigurationEncryptionKey`, `Telerik.Upload.ConfigurationHashKey`, or `Telerik.Web.UI.DialogParametersEncryptionKey` | All apps with RadAsyncUpload |
| 3 | RadPersistenceManager does not use `CookieStateStorageProvider`; `RadDockLayout.LayoutPersistenceRepositoryType` is not `Cookies` | Apps using PersistenceFramework |
| 4 | `StorageProviderKey` is not derived from Request data | Apps using AppDataStorageProvider |
| 5 | `Telerik.AsyncUpload.TemporaryFolder` points outside `App_Data` (defense-in-depth) | Apps with both RadAsyncUpload and RadPersistenceManager |

>important This is intended as a temporary stopgap until you can update the application to use the new release, do not rely on mitigation as a long-term strategy.

### Mitigation 1 - Set customErrors to RemoteOnly or On

```xml
<system.web>
  <customErrors mode="RemoteOnly" />
</system.web>
```

### Mitigation 2- Custom Keys in Web.config

The **RELEVANT_KEY** references below refers to any of `Telerik.AsyncUpload.ConfigurationEncryptionKey`, `Telerik.Upload.ConfigurationHashKey`, or  `Telerik.Web.UI.DialogParametersEncryptionKey` in web.config. 

#### Using v2026.2.514 and earlier:

- **Vulnerable Scenario 1** - If you **are** using a **RELEVANT_KEY** in web.config
  1. Remove **RELEVANT_KEY** from web.config, to fall back on `MachineKey.Unprotect` with AES + HMAC
  2. Continue to [Instructions - Generating Strong Machine Keys](#instructions--generating-strong-machine-keys) section
- **Vulnerable Scenario 2** - If you are **not** using **RELEVANT_KEY**
  1. Continue to [Instructions - Generating Strong Machine Keys](#instructions--generating-strong-machine-keys) section

#### Using v2026.2.708 and later:

- **Option 1** - You can use **RELEVANT_KEY** again, it provides stronger protection than machineKey, via AES-GCM
- **Option 2** - Remove **RELEVANT_KEY** to use machineKey, while not as strong as GCM, it is useful for webfarm environments, and you can use the "autogenerate keys at runtime" again.

#### Instructions - Generating Strong Machine Keys

AES + HMAC support and framework-managed key material via machine key config. even a strong custom key will not prevent padding oracle attacks.
Critical - You must manually generate the keys in IIS, using the Autogenerate creates the same HMAC guard collapse as #1

1. Open IIS > select your site > select **Machine Key**
2. **Validation method**: choose HMACSHA256
3. **Automatically generate at runtime** checkboxes: uncheck both (very important!)
4. In the right pane, click **Generate Keys** 
5. In the right pane, click **Apply**
6. In the left pane, select **Application Pools** and recycle the relevant App Pool (very important)


See [Mandatory web.config settings](https://docs.telerik.com/devtools/aspnet-ajax/general-information/web-config-settings-overview#mandatory-additions-to-the-webconfig) for requirements and key generation guidance.

### Mitigation 2.5 Disable the upload handler if not in use

```xml
<appSettings>
  <add key="Telerik.Web.DisableAsyncUploadHandler" value="true" />
</appSettings>
```

### Mitigation 3 - Do not use cookie-based persistence storage

**For RadPersistenceManager** - remove any `CookieStateStorageProvider` configuration. The default `AppDataStorageProvider` is safe:

```csharp
// Page_Init
PersistenceManager1.StorageProvider =
    new AppDataStorageProvider(Server.MapPath("~/App_Data/PersistenceState/"));
```

**For RadDockLayout** - ensure `LayoutPersistenceRepositoryType` is not Cookies:

```csharp
RadDockLayout1.LayoutPersistenceRepositoryType =
    DockLayoutPersistenceRepository.FileSystem;
```

### Mitigation 4 - Do not derive StorageProviderKey from user input

```csharp
// UNSAFE - never do this
// PersistenceManager1.StorageProviderKey = Request.QueryString["userId"];

// Safe - hardcoded key
PersistenceManager1.StorageProviderKey = "my-app-persistence-state";
```

The default key (`TelerikAspNetRadControlsPersistedState`) is safe if you have not overridden it.

### Mitigation 5 - Move RadAsyncUpload temp folder outside App_Data (defense-in-depth)

```xml
<appSettings>
  <add key="Telerik.AsyncUpload.TemporaryFolder" value="~/UploadTemp" />
</appSettings>
```

Create the folder manually and grant write permissions to the application pool identity. This is defense-in-depth only - always apply Mitigation 4 first.
