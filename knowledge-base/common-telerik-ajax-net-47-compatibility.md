## Environment
| Product | Telerik UI for ASP.NET AJAX |
| ------- | -------------------------- |
| Version | all |

## Description
I want to know if Telerik UI for ASP.NET AJAX is compatible with .NET 4.7 and higher versions.

## Solution
Telerik UI for ASP.NET AJAX assemblies built for .NET 4.5 and later versions are backward-compatible with older versions of the .NET Framework. This means that if you update your web application to .NET 4.7 or a higher version, the same Telerik library will still work without any modifications.

For more information, refer to the [Is .NET Framework 4.5 and later backward compatible with the earlier versions?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/migration-guide/versions-and-dependencies#is-net-framework-45-and-later-backward-compatible-with-the-earlier-versions) article.
