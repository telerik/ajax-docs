## Description
I am experiencing an issue during the installation of the Telerik application. After submitting my login details, the application does not redirect from the browser and displays a login timeout error message.

## Cause
The cause of this issue is typically related to a misconfiguration or a problem with the authentication process.

## Solution
To troubleshoot and resolve the installation redirect issue with the Telerik application, follow these steps:

1. Clear your browser cache and cookies to ensure a clean login process.
2. Verify that you have entered the correct login credentials and try again.
3. Check if the login timeout settings are configured correctly in the application's authentication settings.
4. Ensure that the necessary dependencies and libraries are properly installed and up to date.
5. If the issue persists, try accessing the application from a different browser or device to rule out any browser-specific or device-specific issues.
6. Contact your system administrator or the support team for further assistance if none of the above steps resolve the issue.

## Notes
- It is recommended to check for any relevant error messages in the browser console or application logs for further troubleshooting.
- Make sure that your internet connection is stable and not experiencing any disruptions.
