## HOW TO

Hide menu items that the user should not see (for example, because their user role does not have permissions).

## SOLUTION

There are two primary ways of doing that:

- ensure those items are never created in the first place
- OR, set their Visible property to false according to the business logic


You can find attached [here](files/common-hide-menu-items.zip) a few examples of accessing items and hiding them in various scenarios (declarative creation, programmatic creation, data binding).
