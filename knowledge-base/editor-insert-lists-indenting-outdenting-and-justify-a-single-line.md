## Introduction

During the years we are trying to create the RadEditor with easy to use functionalities and many features. With the main goal, creating an MS Word-like editor, there are outlined some conflicts in the behavior of commands like inserting a list, indenting, outdenting and justifying a single line. The main differences in rich text formatting of the editor is the use of the browser's engine, on which the control relies. The problem is that these browsersâ€™ commands produce quite different HTML content under the different browsers.

## Problem

Inserting a list, indenting, outdenting and justify affects a block of text instead of just the selected line.

## Description

When typing lines of text in the editor's content hitting enter will append an <br> element at the end of the line. Since the lines that are separated by <br> elements are still interpreted as a whole block, executing the following operations will affect all of them:
* Inserting list;
* Indent;
* Outdent;
* Justify;


For example the typed lines of text will look like that in the HTML mode:

````ASP.NET
Line 1<br>
Line 2<br>
Line 3
````

After selecting LIne 2 and pressing the Bullet List button, the HTML output will be formatted as shown below:

````ASP.NET
<ul>
    <li>Line 1<br />
    Line 2<br />
    Line 3</li>
</ul>
````

## Solution

The following examples are workaround solutions for this issue:

After typing a line of text, you can press the New Paragraph button. This way the entered content will be formed as a block element and only the content after the new line will be affected by the operations mentioned above.
Setting the NewLineMode ="P" will format all lines into paragraphs on hitting the Enter key (insert new line) and respectively to block elements.
   
````ASP.NET
<telerik:RadEditor ID="RadEditor1" runat="server" NewLineMode="P"></telerik:RadEditor>
````

The following override of the indent and outdent functionalities will allow you to modify separate lines:

````ASP.NET
<telerik:RadEditor ID="RadEditor1" runat="server">
</telerik:RadEditor>
<script>
    (function ($, $E, undefined) {
 
        if (!$E) return;
 
        $E.CommandList.Indent =
        $E.CommandList.Outdent = function (commandName, editor, oTool) {
            editor.setActive();
 
            var bCanUnexecute = "SelectAll" != commandName;
 
            //Unlink only works on fully selected links in FireFox
            if (commandName == "Unlink" && !editor.isIE) {
                var elem = editor.getSelectedElement();
                if (elem && elem.tagName == "A") editor.selectElement(elem, false); //false => avoid throwing selection changed
            }
 
            editor.executeBrowserCommand(commandName, bCanUnexecute, null, null);
 
            //Update tool state
            return true;
        };
 
    })($telerik.$, Telerik.Web.UI.Editor);
</script>
````
