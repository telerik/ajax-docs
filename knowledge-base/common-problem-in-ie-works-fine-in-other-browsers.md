## Description

An issue manifests under Internet Explorer (IE) only, but it does not under other browsers (such as Chrome, Firefox, Edge).

Problems can include appearance issues, misaligned components, missing icons, JavaScript errors.


## Solution

The most likely reason for such a problem is the IE falls in to the unsupported Compatibility Mode which puts it in IE7 mode (or even lower).

You can read more about discerning and avoiding this mode in the [Different appearance or behavior in Internet Explorer on local and production servers](https://www.telerik.com/support/kb/aspnet-ajax/details/different-appearance-in-internet-explorer-on-local-and-production-servers) article.
