## HOW TO

Filter the files shown to the user when selecting a file to upload through RadAsyncUpload.

This allows the user to only see the files they can upload and you, as the developer, can limit that choice.

## DESCRIPTION

With current browsers (IE9 and above, Chrome, Firefox), RadAsyncUpload uses the HTML5 `FileAPI` to upload files.

Browsers can interpret the `accept` attribute of the `<input type="file"/>` in order to filter the files the end user can see through their MIME types.

## SOLUTION

You can define a set of MIME types that match the extensions you want to allow and **set** the **accept attribute** of the **file input** in the [OnClientAdded event]({%slug asyncupload/client-side-programming/onclientadded%}). Keep in mind that some file formats should be passed as extension, e.g. for a Comma Separated Excel file, you should add `.csv` in the `data-clientFilter` attribute.

````ASP.NET
<telerik:RadAsyncUpload runat="server" ID="RadAsyncUpload1"

    AutoAddFileInputs="true">
</telerik:RadAsyncUpload>
 
<script>
    function OnClientAdded(sender, args) {
        var allowedMimeTypes = $telerik.$(sender.get_element()).attr("data-clientFilter");
        $telerik.$(args.get_row()).find(".ruFileInput").attr("accept", allowedMimeTypes);
    }
