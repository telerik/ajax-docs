## Problem

Exploiting .NET JavaScriptSerializer Deserialization ([CVE-2019-18935](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-18935)) issue through RadAsyncUpload can lead to executing malicious code on the server in the context of the w3wp.exe process.

## Prerequisites for an Attack

 - An attacker can break the RadAsyncUpload encryption (or have prior knowledge of your custom encryption keys) and stage a malicious request.

 - The type whitelisting feature of RadAsyncUpload is not enabled (see [AllowedCustomMetaDataTypes appSettings key]({%slug asyncupload-security%}#allowedcustommetadatatypes)). 


## Solution

To make sure you are not vulnerable we recommend that you upgrade to R1 2020 or later as shown in the diagram below:
