# Description
When using RadEditor to enter notes, an error occurs when underlining content. The error log indicates a server-side error with HTTP status 403 Forbidden. 

# Steps to Reproduce
1. Use RadEditor to enter text.
2. Apply the underline format to the text.
3. Save or submit the content.

# Cause
The error is caused by aggressive AWS firewall rules, specifically the CrossSiteScripting_BODY rule, which blocks the request made by RadEditor when underlining content.

# Solution
To effectively resolve this error and restore full functionality to RadEditor, follow the steps outlined below:
1. Identify the Firewall Settings: Understand the firewall settings in your environment. In cases reported, AWS firewall rules were found to be the cause.
2. Adjust Firewall Rules: Locate and disable the `CrossSiteScripting_BODY` rule or similar rules that could be incorrectly identifying RadEditor's underline function as a threat. This action should be performed with caution to ensure that disabling these rules does not inadvertently lower your site's security posture.
3. Verify Configuration Changes: After adjusting the firewall settings, repeat the steps to reproduce the error to ensure that the issue has been resolved.
