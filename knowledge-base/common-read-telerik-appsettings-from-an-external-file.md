### HOW TO

Load the Telerik appSettings flags from an external file.

### DESCRIPTION

The UI for ASP.NET AJAX controls provide [a lot of switches and settings you can set from the appSettings section in the web.config]({%slug general-information/web-config-settings-overview %}#control-properties-you-can-set-from-the-webconfig. In some cases you may want to declutter the web.config file and read these settings from a separate file. This can even facilitate deployment and testing, especially if you also use your own flags in the appSettings section.

### SOLUTION

ASP.NET allows you to import sections of the web.config file from an external file that is under the same folder. To do this:

1. copy the `appSettings` section in your desired configuration file (e.g., in *~/App_Data/myAppSettings.config*)
1. remove the contents of the `appSettings` section
1. set the `configSource` attribute of the `appSettings` tag to point to the external file (*configSource="App_Data\myAppSettings.config"*). Note the backslash that denotes a physical path.

You can find attached a small example below. Just add the Telerik assemblies to the `~/bin` folder.
