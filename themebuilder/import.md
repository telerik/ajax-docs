# Importing a Theme 



The **Theme Builder** tool enables you to upload your own theme that you have created previously. You need to select the *Import existing theme* option.

>note You must upload both **ScssPrimitives.json** and **UsedControls.json** files in order for the imported theme to be recognized correctly.

Once you have uploaded the theme you can customize it as described in the [create and download]({%slug introduction/themebuilder/create-and-download%}) article.
